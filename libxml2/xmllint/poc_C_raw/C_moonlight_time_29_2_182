<!ENTITY d "?&d; the mainstreaming
      of big data, linked data, and open data. Often these datasets are in XMng of an unknown set of elements, attributes,
      namespaces, and content models. This paper describes an approach for
      quickly summarizing as well as guiding exploration into a non-indexed
      XML database. Finally, this paper demonstrates a statistical technique
      to approximate faceted uearch over large datasets, without the need of
      particular index configurations.</para>
