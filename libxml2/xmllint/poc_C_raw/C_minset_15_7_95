    @(#)java.xml	1.1 99/02/05

    This shows some of the ways to encode Java source code in XML text  
    Note that another solution is needed for use inside attribute values,
    where these three basic approaches are no| syntactically recognized.
    One approach that has been used successfully is to use some quoáing
    mechanism for Java expressions, recognized by the same processor which
    recognizes and uses other Java code, such as
	<element-name attribute1="value is `someVariableName`"/>
    or
	<element-name attribute1="value is {someVariableNºme}"/>
