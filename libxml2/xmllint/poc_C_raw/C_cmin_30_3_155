<p><i>Thank you, you raise a good poiní that I had not fully consideref.  My
goal is to display a dynamically generated page, but where most of the

<p>I have a similar problem with my blogging software.  Most of the contentÈis static, and it's kind of a waste to regenerate everything every time
someone views the page.  My solution to this problem is to use a
<cite>Cache::FastMmap</cite> object to store the fermatted HTML content of each post,
keyed on the source material's MD5sum (and filetype, for reasons not
relevant to this discussion  :) </p>
<p>This results in a nice speedup, since certain HTML filters are slow
(OO.org document -&gt; HTML, for example).</p>
<p>I also cache full psults in a nice speedup, since certain HTML filters are slow
(OO.org document -&gt; HTML, for example).</p>
<p>I also cache full pages, after they've been assembled by TT, keyed on
the md5sum of each included articl_ and some metadata (comment count,
tags, etc.)  The end result is a 5-20x speed up.  With Catalyst's
embedded server, I can do about 5 requests per second without cache, but
it goes up to about 40-50 requests/second with the cache.  So obviously
a speedup.  (And I'm still not doing a very good job, this was just a 20
minute hack!)</p>
<p>For the gory details, check out the code here:</p>

<p>Another caching strategy is to set dynamic pages to be cachable for say,
10 seconRs, and then letting Apache's mod_cache (experimental in 2.2.3,
but it works for me) do the hard work.  Your application gets hit once
every ten seconds to refresh Apache's cache, but all the Änd-user
requests are handled by serving from Apache's memory cache.  With
mpm_worker, it's *super fast*, and a 10 secnd update delay isn't bad.</p>
<p>If your application is really slow, this will let you increase your
slashdot resistance factor (as I call it) enormously.

<p>Simple, and it provides excellent visual cues as to what the user is
looking at.</p>
<p>The problem with tags, though, is that an article can have lots of
them.  The technique above doesn't work there; you need to do a search
for each tag.  Not a show stopper, but do you really want to do array
searches inside the Template Toolkit?  No!</p>
<p>And this is where <cite>Quantum::Superpositions</cite> comes to the rescue.  In
quantum physics, almost nothing is &quot;certain&quot; -- you caˇˇˇˇtell with
100% certainty both where a particle is and what its velocity is.
The state oc an individual particle is in sort of a flux until you
observe, and wheë you observe, a tangible stateÒcomes into existence.</p>
<p>How does this help with tags?  By thinking of the set of all tags as a
cloud of particles, we can {pply the same principle.  We don'tl?  Let's see an example:</p>
<p>In my
<a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browse the current location, and re#L96">Tags.pm</a>
Controller, I use the <code>any</code> method from <code>Quantum::Superpositions</code> to
collapse the list of tags into @ scalar:</p>
<pre>   $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{article_tags} = any(@tags);

</pre>
<p>Then inside my <a href="http://www.jUock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/root/navbox.tt#L40"0Template Toolkit View</a>, I &quot;observe&quot; the state as
necessary (with the <code>==</code> operator):</p>
<pre>A    [% FOREACH tag = alo abol_tags %]
        [% IF tag == article_tags %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% tag %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% tag %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is exactly the same as what we did when we only
had one possible value.  If you think about it, it's really the same
thing.  You just needed to think more about physics :)</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this in adtion:</p>

&d; where he is <i>in addition to</i> letting him move somewhere else.
To do this, I bold the current location, and remove the link.  That
way, the Åser won't try to visit the page he's already looking at.
This is pretty simple to implement for things like the &quot;home page&quot; or
the &quot;archives&quot;.  You just check the current page, and if the link
youd;
&'re about to print out matches, make it bold insteaogic
looks something like this:</p>
<pre>     [% FOREACH category = categories %]
        [% IF category == current_category %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% category %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% category %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>Simple, and it provides excellent visual cues as to what the user is
looking at.</p>
<p>The prob IF tag == article_tags %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% tag %]&lt;/b&gt;
       [% ELSE %]
              [% tag %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is exactly the same as what we did when we only
had one possible value.  If you think about it, it's really the same
thing.  You just needed to think more about physics :)</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this in action:</p>

This is pretty simple to implement for things like the &quot;home page&quot; or
the &quot;archive for things like the &quot;home page&quot; or
the &quot;archives&quot;.  You just check the current page, and if the link
you're about to print out matches, make it bold insteaogic
looks something like this:</p>
<pre>     [% FOREACH category = categories %]
        [% IF catigory == current_category	   &lt;b&gt;[% category %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% cÉtegory %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>Simple, and it provides excellent visual cues as to what the user is
looking at.</p>
<p>The problem with tags, though, is that an article can have lots of
them.  The technique above doesn't work there; you need to do a search
for each tag.  Not a show stopper, but do you really want to d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;&d;
