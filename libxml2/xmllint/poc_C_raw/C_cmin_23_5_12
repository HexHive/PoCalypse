2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and
comments from the proofreaders as possible:

move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fr((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((eaking, and are NOT legal in 
system identifiers (processor 'may' signal an error).
Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOT DONE YET:
change binary / text to unparsed / parsed.
handle James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values
uppercase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>

</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>
<sitem>1997-09-25 : TB : Change to elm's new DTD, wiÿh
substantial detail cleanup as a side-effect</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-24 : CMSMcQ : correct error (lost term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first in an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic chtnges,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for ignored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs finding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating tŠ element content (?).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft:

Change def of %operator.
Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on
well-formed:   Webster's Second hyphenates it, and that's enough
for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31 : Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>

<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clafluttering her hand at me as if to say she cannot do it herself, but that it is not worth the trouble. I think she is worth the trouble, and know she tries not to grunt when I put her across my shoulders and carry her home. Sometimes the walk home is very long, and I see that it is a large distance she has walked. Then, there are more and more frequent pauses as I stop to catch my breath, and listen for her slow breathing. Sometimes she has only just made it around the corner of our street, and then I turn around to see the curtains falling back down, the neighbors pretending not to have been watching. I would not look at them if I was Marianne, but I think she does. I think Marianne sees a lot of things I would not want to see if I were her. 	When she is back on the drooping couch, she does not look at me. I intend to fix the sofa; I will give it proper cushions with full ends and upholstery that doesnâ€™t remind us of nineteen eighty-two. I will take away the brown-flowered curtains in her bedroom, and find clean white ones to go in their stead. The rugs should not be faded, the bed should not sag and creak the way it does, and there should be neither linoleum nor a plastic table cover in the kitchen. Marianne never thought that being an invalid would mean old red and green and beige and pale blue flowered sheets to hide the stains from when she could not keep herself from coughing in the night. She did not think there would be coughing in the day, too, and that some of it would be done in bed. I never (have never, do never, will never) ask her why she walks barefoot out the door sometimes, so long that I must go find her. I would not want to sleep on a tired, springy bed with stained sheets either. I do anyway. 	Finally, Marianne looks up at me from the couch. I am sitting in the armchair across the room, watching her and waiting for the present moment. She wants to ask me what we shall do this afternoon. Anything you like, I can say, giving her the decision. She will not be able to make up her mind, and we will turn the cushions backward on the sofa to redistribute the old fluff inside. There will not be anything worth watching on the TV, and we will be admittedly too lazy to pull out a CD player, so we will just sit. My arm goes around her shoulders, she slouches against me, and everything is just the way it ought to be. I will have to push her away, then, because her skin is too hot and I am afraid that I will begin to burn if she does not let go of me soon.  	Sitting on the sofa this way will only make new sofa memories over the old ones, and I do not want to revise the past. I will not suggest or move or even look to sitting with my arm around her on the left and left-middle gap cushions because I remember when her skin was cool. She did not cough so very much then (and coughing rubbish up was rare). Marianne and I are quite well matched, I think. The neighbors say so, and they laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Chotky have their prejudice intact (Marianne sees them and smiles all the same), but I happen to know that Marianne is not going to ask me what to do this afternoon because she does not want me to pull away from her. She knows what I am thinking. This is good. Even fevered people can be soul mates. Even fevered people can read minds, if they could before. 	There are many things that Marianne can do, these days. She can walk half a mile, in shoes, without fainting. She can, usually, dress herself. She can manage our calendar; every so often she will update it with colored crayons to mark the days in which we will go to a park or a museum or Ikea to sit on the furniture. I am teaching her to make pancakes from the bag, and she is teaching me to bake brownies from the box. Sometimes she has trouble with the flipping and the mixing, but that is why I am here. My arms are fairly strong, she says, though my culinary genius does not yet extend beyond pre-packaged food. I try not to remember that she does not have the energy to stand and work for longer than it takes to make boxed brownies. She particularly likes the interval between opening the box and eating the brownies, when she can watch me become befuddled and laugh. Youâ€™re learning, she says, you have to be the one to sort the process out. I laugh too, of course, and if the brownies are miserable because I forgot the yoghurt this time, we laugh again. She can laugh a lot, these days. 	One day, I bring her a book that I have bought in the subway station on the way home from work. I have a part-time job in an architectâ€™s office as a kind of gopher, only they pay me more because they know my girl is terminally ill. We deny that it is terminal, but accept the money anyway. Perhaps someday Iâ€™ll get a real job there, and move up the totem pole? Twenty-six and Iâ€™m only starting off. I think weâ€™ll be okay. Marianne protests that she is not okay- She does not really want the book I brought today, or the cards from yesterday, or the disposable camera from the day before. She wants me home, of course, she wants to be well again, and she wants a bottle of Lysol to clean her sheets with. I tell her that she might not want Lysol for her sheets, but she is adamant.  	In the end, we strip the bed and dunk the sheets in Clorox. We soak and drown and inundate the sheets with Clorox. [The sheets] are now slightly closer to white than they were before, but have mostly faded into beige. She is begging me for brooms, for vacuums, which we have, and for heavy duty window cleaner and ammonia based cleaning products, which we havenâ€™t. Formula 409, while probably toxic, does not smell the same way ammonia does. It is also advertised as biodegradable, and I thus see it as a good investment. Marianne does not think that Formula 409 will rid her house of the old invalid smell. Twenty-six and this is how it ends, she says. Then she looks at me solemnly, and points out in all seriousness that she intends to scrub her soul of disease with ammonia. I do not want to laugh, because she may honestly intend to wash herself with floor cleaner, and if I laugh she will swallow it just to spite me. This must be stopped. I snort accidentally, in the effort to breathe calmly through my nose. Again, I snort a little, and my mouth is twitching, so is hers, she is laughing a little, then I am, and then we both are, as ever. Marianne flips to the first page of the book I have given her and shows me that a) it is a romance novel, and b) the main character is intending to scrub her soul with something or other. She had begun reading while I was searching for Clorox, and found it devilishly amusing. I begin to wonder if she is honestly as tired of living in a sick house as I am, or if sheâ€™s only made that up to use a line. Shame upon me, because of course sheâ€™s tired of living here; Marianne is here more often than I am. Marianne is always here. 	On Saturday morning, I make a feeble attempt to sleep past nine. I do not like venturing into the real world at 6:45 daily to make money- some days I am still a teenager. Marianne is a teenager too. 8:45 AM and she is sitting on my bed, considering shaking me awake, considering staring at me until I wake up, considering doing neither, and finally just staring out of sheer nervousness that I might die if she shakes me too hard. You are fragile, she says. I wake up, of course, and ask her if I have kicked her in the night. You are fragile, I say. Then I want to kick myself, because of course she has her own room, own bed, now, with Clorox-ed sheets. I must kick myself again and again, to remember that I am not going to forget sleeping with her nearby when her skin felt white and her rubbish landed in the pot by her pillow. It is all right, of course; a slip of the tongue at 8:45 is forgiven by her because we are going to make pancakes again. She will be a fast learner and a fast talker when she gets tired. Marianne has stopped getting cranky when she is tired. She is tired often, I think. 	When we are getting ready for bed, Marianne often sits on the bathtub ledge to watch me brush my teeth. She is very philosophical, then. You know, she says, having toothpaste on your nose is like having banana on your chin. Here, I want to laugh, but doing so while brushing my teeth opens my mouth dangerously wide. I think thatâ€™s why she says the things she does, to see toothpaste dribble out of the corner of my usually neat mouth. She strikes me as so young, then, or at least so fun. Itâ€™s funny that you connect the two, she says. Twenty-six and thatâ€™s just where we are, love, twenty-six. She pauses, and I stare at the mirror, brushing heartily away; thinking. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™ve learned something from her. There is no lesson from her sickness, and I donâ€™t want there to be; lessons mean closure, and weâ€™re not finished yet. Weâ€™re going to make her well, weâ€™re going to move across the country, and weâ€™re going to be young and beautiful doing it. I grin, and lose a little toothpaste out the side of my mouth. I think weâ€™ll be fine, I say. Twenty-six is a good place for us.

      Edge-of-Jungle Scene 	It is late afternoon, and the smaller animals are gravitating towards the watering hole. Its uneven blackness spans a large area, with a graying log floating in the center. The animals appear to avoid this potential resting spot in favor of hovering around the edges to drink and retreat into the shadows. More grey, ropey branches lie tangled across the surface of the water, from the fall of the central rotting trunk. The jungle populace holds its distance from these deadly cords, the nearest life form being a single toadstool growing in the shadows. An adventurous pale green frog has recently begun swimming near the opposite shore, but the others wait in the shadows for proof that the predators have already come and left.   Keyboard pad, keyboard, cords, paperclip bowl, post-it notes  	A large rock stands atop a nearby plateau, overlooking the watering hole. It has a smooth, thin surface, with a blackness that the pond reflects. A frequent origin of strange noises, only the tiniest and bravest of creatures seek protection here- purple speckled tree frog of the same species as the pale green swimmer, and a colony of white moths.  Computer monitor, post-its, business cards  	Off to the leftmost side of the pond, after a safe space of red earth (trampled into circles and ovals by the larger animals), a large sloth has emerged to hydrate itself. The sloth is of a very light grey, and has not moved for at least twenty minutes. It is difficult to discern which end is its head and which its tail. Neither end nor sides produces limbs of any kind. Breathing is also not visible, but it is expected that it will soon â€˜awakenâ€™ to drink and slink away. This manner of appearing dead or inanimate is a defense mechanism of the grey Jungle Sloth. Cashmere sweater 	Tree branches swing low by the right side of the water. On top of these sit a variety of birds, possibly unsure as to whether the fallen tree branches are snakes or plants. One bird, a deep brown creature of the Armanus family, has opened his wings silently, revealing tan wingtips to indicate that his status as a male of mating age. He sits triumphantly atop a red jungle worm that he has crushed into submission. It no longer struggles for freedom.  Irmani glasses case, red CD case  	Behind this more colorful bird sit a collection of oddly shaped birds. The first two are crows, one starved and gaunt, and the other with a tumor on his rear end such that he appears curved up at each end. Their black feathers are no longer shiny, perhaps indicating a flight across the desert to the edge of the jungle, here. They, too, await the clearing of the watering hole. Next to these two characters sits a black vulture with a particularly bulbous head, which he swings at random moments so as to inspire fear into the sloth and the other faking-death animals. However, his possession of a bit of still-red rhinoceros carcass indicates that he is no longer on the hunt. At his side is the last crow, with longer feathers than the others, looking particularly mild for the hot weather. A cool breeze blows in, and the purple speckled frog leaps into the watering hole.
