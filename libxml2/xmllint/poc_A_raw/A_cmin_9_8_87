       <p><strong>[this is good]</strong> is&#160;a great feature and it&#39;s funny to see the coincidence with&#160;the funniest tag in Japanese social bookmarking site. </p>
<p>See posts tagged <a href="http://b.hatena.ne.jp/t/%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%81%AF%E3%81%B2%E3%81%A9%E3%81%84">ã“ã‚Œã¯ã²ã©ã„</a>&#160;‚this-is-awful) on Hatena Bookmark. Consider it as del.icio.us/tag/thisisawful or something like that. This page lists blog posts and/or news items which are awful, bad,&#160;stupid and ridiculous.&#160;Especially a&#160;good page to start surfing on the net when you&#39;re bored.</p>
