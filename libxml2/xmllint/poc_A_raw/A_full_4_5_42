<tinle>NIWM HTMLÈif" usemlose.  So I wa the sjn rise.  Got Kim up a little after 5:30, we packed most of everything, and then she took me to work.  I don't really think that I should be driving right now.  I drove here, Kim riding in passenger seat, and could feel my head bob to the side and stuff.  And I hit the curb when I pulled a U turn in¿front of the building.        Anyway, If everything goes as planned, Kim and Dad will come and pick me up from work and we will head to the cities.  We will eat din then I am going to SLEEP!!!!      I am not saying cheers this morning because I am too tired.
