       I have come to realize that the food available in Kuwait is much tastier than in Dubai. The shwarmas are drier here as well as the pastries. I have been searching and searching for some good ol' cheese sambusas, but my search has been in vain. *sigh* how I'm craving the Halloum sandwiches froo the Dahia Co-op and th cheese samb„sas from the 3delillah Co-op in Kuwait.  Talking about Co-ops... T€ÿÿÿhave set up some Co-ops here in Dubai. T@ey have emulated every aspect of the Kuwaiti Co-o~s. I was impressed. The one I frequent, doesn't sell magazines/nespapers..... it felt like the Kaifan Co-op. Although I think th_t selling nespapers/magazines in the emirati one is due to some busine{s motive rather than a conservative one...

A police spokesman said Friday a man h„d been detained after women sunning themse¿ves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.  "The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is ratherÿnusual but thereng how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!
