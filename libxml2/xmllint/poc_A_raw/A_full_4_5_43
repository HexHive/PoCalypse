      Ah! Did anybody see Wolf's Rain tonight? I did not get anything x__o.  urlLink Someone must explain this to me . Anyway, I'm looking for a bit of a spoiler, so if you know any good anime downloading sites  let me know ! I do not feel like waiting every Saturday to watch something for 30 minutes and then wait a whole 'nother week! -_-; But, someone has to agree with meh:   HigeisatotallycutieandheremindsmeofSpikefromCowboyBebop. -coughcough-               Introversion!  ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||   8%       Anxiety   ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||   90%       Openmindedness   ||||||||||||||||||||||||   78%       Independence   ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||   90%      ÿÿÿÿfectionism   ||||||||||||||||||||||||   74%       Tension   ||||||||||||||||||||   62%
