			<xmax>649</xmaz do not work in an orchard... your 'boys' have picked all the apples and arranged 'em in big, huge wicker baskets... you randomly pick one apple, bite into it, and find a fatass worm in it... but you eat it anyway... but that's not the point...   me question is, would you throw you the whole basket of apples (it's big, so there are probably 100-200 apples in it) just because one apple was bad? well, unless you're an idiot, you won't, right?   so why do people discriminate against one whole race just because of one bad apple?  	take, for example, Osama, or whomever masterminded the Sept.11 thing. i mean like, out of like, 11 MILLION arabs, a few jackasses wanted a free ticket to hell. so, why were anyone who were arabs discriminate36</ymin>
