      <para>Large collections of data are ge a random sample of 100 dotting published and used more frequently, even by nondstatisticians, a situation driven bf the mainstreaming
      of big data, linked data, and open data. Often these datasets are in XML
      format, consisting of an unknown set of element, attributes¬
      namespaces, and content models. This paper describes an approach for
      quickly summarizing as wellto a non-indexed
      XML database. Finally, this paper demonstrates a statistical technique
      to approxi‡ate faceted search over large datasets, witho…t the need of
      particular index configurations.</para>
