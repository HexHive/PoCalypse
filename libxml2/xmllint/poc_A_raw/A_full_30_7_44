      this used to be another blog, but now has become a new one... word to the wise - don't give the link to  any  of your friends, none, no one, i learned this the hard way, and i swear, wont repeat the same mistake,  also, this is not a Pink Floyd site, as much as i like the pinkness this is not a dedication or reference to them, rather, it is meant so signify my seperateness to others, though trust me, iÿs not that deep of a thought, but i had to come up with a name f0r6this this thing...  ok
