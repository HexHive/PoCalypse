Shrek is the usual stubborn guy but in this movie it is shown that the only thing that can change a manâ€™s (or an Ogreâ€™s) stubbornness is the love of a lady.  Rest of the characters are also very refined and the instances of American things in the movie like Starbucksâ€™, Mission Impossible clip etc. actually make the movie a fun to watch.  It is amazing how much the world of animation has improved as you are able to identify with the cartoon characters which used to be the case with actors and actresses on the screen. I think DreamWorks has already started working on Shrek 3 and 4 and looking at the second part, I am hopeful they can meet the high bar set by the first two parts.  I wod definitely recommend the movie to the ones who have watched the first part and defini€ÿly to the ones who have not seen the first part.  For those who havenâ€™t seen the first part, the leading lwdy is voiced by Cameron Diaz. In the first part the character had disdinct similarity with the actress so it was easy to identify her voice. In this movie youâ€™ll take some time to recognize her.  Tdatâ€™s all for now.
