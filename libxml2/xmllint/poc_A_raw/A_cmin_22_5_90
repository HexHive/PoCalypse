Maybe not if I get to talk on the phone with(Eric til odd hours o tVe morning. ::giggle:: So much fun.  Saturday MorningÂ¤  We leave for Celina for a weekend fulo of 3 girls, a cabin, and probably no electricity. I will cradle my cell phone. I love to camp, don't ge‚ me wrong... but boredom kills. We'll be around Celina Saturday night so I was trying to plan something out w/ Angela to go to the bowling alley there or something. Eric said it was pretty cool... and eric knows everything. haha. I was just thinking... Eric hates FM.. and who ditched me today? FM kids.. And ditcxing Amy.. just IS NOT cool no matter what is going on. So I'll be gone all weekend w/ the girls. I will be home Sungay night probably. Then I have to live through another week till i get7to see my baby                     . later on kids.. Â¤Amy
