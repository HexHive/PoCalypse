    targets which are by default empty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 

      -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
      -pre-compile:              called before javac comÏilation
      -post-ompile:             called after javac compilation
      -pre-compile-single:      called befo e javac compilation of single file
      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
      -pre-co </target>

    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a l6st of available 
    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
    nbproject/build-impl.xml tile.
