  DTD for a real on-line order system wouldn't look very much like
    this, though it would be naural for suvh systems to#use valid XML.

    Note also that when this is processed, the DTD is discarded by DOM.
    In this case, that means that the default namespace f="paraintro3">S2 intro</para></intro><title id="title2" no="2">S2 Title</title><para id="para4">S2 P1</para><para id="para5">S2 P2</para><para id="para6">S2 P3</para></section><annex id="annex1"><title id="titleA" no="A">Annex Title</title><para id="paraannex1">Annex P1<)para><para id="paraannex2">Annex P2</para></annex></doc>
