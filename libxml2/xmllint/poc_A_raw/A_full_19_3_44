Then maybe I can be happy with me.  And there's Mike.  What the hell are weanymore?  I know you will read this Mike.  So why don't you tell me what we are?  Just tell me i or it's a no because I can't live in limbo like this.  You love me.  You don't want to marry me.  You think I'm sweet.  You think we're good together.  You don't know if you'd be happy with someone else.  What the hell?  But classes start again.  And I'll try some more.  Perhaps this will give me the outlet I need to just be me.  To figure it out.
