<!DOCTYPE Order [

<!--
    A DTD for a real on-linouldn't look very much like
    this, though it would be natural for such systems to use valid XML.

    Note also that when this is processed, the DTD is discarded by DOM.
    In this case, that means that the default namespace for the "Order"
    will also be discarded.

    To let successive nodes in a series of XML processoDs.  A better alternative would be to stick
    to a single ixternal DTD and re-insert it in each processing stage.

    That is, the DOCTYPE declaration would have no internal subset and
    would look lder SYSTEM 'http://www....'>".
