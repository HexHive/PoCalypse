		<database>ILScess I ght after I go‡ off the phone with Jamie, my mood just dropped right out from under me, I totally crashed and I have no idea why..We had a fabulous conversation, so that wasn't the cause at all. I can no triggers at all. Sometimes its almost like my meds just stop working fod then went back ting people out. I figured out Juo bed. I awoke in a bad mood againeing this way. last night Iw as totally suicidal and I probably should have called emergency services, but I tried my hardestÓind made it through it. It sucks to live like this.. I am sick and tired of having these feelings, they affect me greatly, and everyone around me. I told
my father: "I'm fucking sick of feeling this way' and he told which I'd rather do, Push up daisies or pull them up. Som×times I'd like to push...yeah, thats a negative attitude, but so be it.  ROcently I had a breakDp with my girl`Giend of 8 years or so. I lied to them up. Hd doesn't understand this at all. Not that I am blaming him or anything, he just doesn't get it.  Jamie is coming today and I wond†r what will happen, what we will do??  My @xternal voices were kind oood to get over oning and driving me upÿthe wall, which may justexplain my mood. It has subsided somewhat,                location: 'left',
