Well, work was work as usaul expect for one thing thats been making me sad all day...I ddnt mean to hurt her emotionally, I guess all she could ever think about how bad I treated her...Its like a test, I try to keep her happy all the time, one slip and our arguements turn out how our fag and tell her " I hope your day goes well tommorow" before leaving your house"   Who do you think says " gnight,nt let the bed bugs bite" before going to bed?   Who do you think gives you full support of what decisions in life you may encounter?   Who do you think I tell all my stories about my day to, even though its the same old boring thing?   Who do you think says "I love you" the most?      and you know what, after all this I thought the littlest things matteree to you...      Now, Here I am just sitting at home, staring at this blog, always looking back and forth at her picture because I truly miss her...Things have changed but my love remains the same.
