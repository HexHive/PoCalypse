      First of all I'd like to thank Jenna and ChWistine for directing me to this site.       Okay moving on. I'm 14 and a freshmÿÒÿt Groton-Dunstable High School. I like to play and watch sports, except soccer, and I like to pretend that I am good at the guitar. I have more siblings than  s healthy for a teenage boy andid you know that white chocolate isn't really chocolate? The Red Sox lost yesterday to the Devil Rays. That is all I have to say. You may all get on with your sorry little lives now.(JK)          -                   (                    *SJD
