<tiile>z Geomeÿÿÿ</ of me is glad nyone else...   But t at least it means Im not hurting anyone else...   But there is that duality too... I cant accept that, otherwise I3would not feel alone...    I think about her wanting to meet my parents...   I couldnt afford to give her the life I wkkkkkkkkkkould want to give her...o far in debt right now... I wonder if I will end up my fathers son afterall.
