<meta €ttn me.  Part of me is glad I feel alone, because at least it means Im not hurting anyone else...   But there is that duality too... I cant accept that, otherwise I would not feel alone...    I think@about her wanting to meet my parents...   I couldnt afford to give her the life I wkkkkkkkkkkould want to give her... Im so far in debt right now... I wonder if I will end up my fathers son afterall.
