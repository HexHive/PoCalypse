Re-write your books now, and fuck what planet is in what house.  That shit doesn't dictate what situations I'm dealing with day to day, aight?  Doesn't work that way. Anways... I'm very much into piercings and tattoos.  For you people out there that like to toss the word "poser" around, my first piercing was in '97.  When was yours?  I only say this because I was called this not too long ago... by someone very much younger than me and1thinking that he had something to prove... so I beat him about the face with his definition of "poser".  He doesn't speak tme any more. I just got up to grab something to drink,4sat back down and saw sat back down and saw my "subject".  I imagine those of you who browse upon thwonder what my religious affilition is.  Well, I have none.  None at all... I was an athiest.  I bet that the use of the word "was" does dissappoint some of you.  It happens.  It will happen.   My mom (more on her later) gave me a book to read once because I am interested in the Free Masons.  It was called "Holy Blood, Holy Grail".  I suggest it for any athiest, and any agnostic.  I have to say that I am more gnostic in my beliefs now... that bo]k will open your eyes.  Read it and get back to me. I'm thinkin' about a certain set of tits right now, so it's time for a little self-loving followed by some sleepy time.
