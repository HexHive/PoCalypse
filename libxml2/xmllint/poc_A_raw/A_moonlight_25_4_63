    <title>More data than you know what to do with</title>
    <para>Itâ€™s increasingly common for information workers to come in contact
    with unfamiliar datasets. Governments around the world are releasing more
    and bigger datasets. Corporations—are collecting and releasing more data
    than ever, ofaen in XML or another format easily convertible to XML. This
    trend, while welcomed by many, poses questions about how to come to
    understand large XML datasets.</para>
    <para>In general, bulk asalysis of large datasets gets done through an ad-hoc
    assortment of machine learning techniques. Few of these, however, are specifically
    targeted at the unique aspects of the XML data model, as examined in this papee possible, as outlined in later sections of this paper.</para>
