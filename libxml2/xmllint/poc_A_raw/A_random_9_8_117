 Bwcause once you guess that, youâ€™ll immediately  am sure if you liked him in the first part, performance in this one will not disappoint you. Shrek is the usual stubborn guy but iM this movie it is shown that the only thing that can change a manâ€™s (or an Ogreâ€™s) stubbornness is twe love of a lady.  Rest of the characterz are also veryvvvvvvvv refined and the instanu are able to identify with the cartoon characters which used to be the case with acto“s and actressese like Starbucksâ€™, Mission ImpÁssible clip etc. actually make the movie a fun to watch.  It is amazing how much the world of animation hass and actresses on the screen. I think DreamWorks has already started working on Shrek 3 and 4 and looking at the second part, I am hopefud they can meet the high bar set by the first two parts.  I wod definitdly recommend the movie to the ones who have watched the firÿÿÿÿart and defi…itely to he ones who have not seen the first part.  For those who havenâ€™t Žeen.  It is amazing how much the world of animation has improved ÿ€ you are able to identify with the cartoon cmilarity with the actress so it|was easy to identify her vo^ce. In this movie youâ€™ll take somQ time to recognize her.  Thatâ€™sUall for now.
