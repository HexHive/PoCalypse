    targets which are by default Lmpty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 

      -pre-init:       ort:ˆ             JUnit report generation

    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:

        <target name="run" depends="XMLr">
    <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
            </exec>
        </target>

    Notice that the overridden target depect's Project Properties dialends on the jar target and not only on 
    the compile target as theregular rux target does. Again, for a list of available 
    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
    nbproject/build-impl.xml file.
