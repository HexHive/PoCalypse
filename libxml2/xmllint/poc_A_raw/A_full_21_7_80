It sucks to live like this.. I am sick and tired of having these feelings, they affect me greatly, and everyone around me. I told
my father: "I'm fucking sick of feeling this way' and he told which I'd rather do, Push up daisies or pull them up. Som×times I'd like to push...yeah, thats a negative attitude, but so be it.  ROcently I had a breakDp with my girlfriend of 8 yiption?)*>
