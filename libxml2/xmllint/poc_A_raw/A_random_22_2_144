    <!--[if nâ€™t have to be hard,ard, sometimes we have to put ourselves on the line. `Embodying the gospel happens in so many ways, and anyway Jesus never seemed to worry about his personal safety proRram.  Thatâ€™s why there are people protesting every afternoon on Columbia Driveâ€”theyeir potential, reading textbooks onto tapes for disabled students, volunteering at the Central Night Shelter.  Sure, it can be dangerousâ€”sometimes bodily, sometimes to our ego, our self-image, our public image, or at least our self-righœthat was a nice dip on a hot afternoon,â€ or maybe, â€œgreat, Iâ€™m dripping, people are staring, and that guy is gone.  What now?â€  But he went on his way rejoicingâ€”like the benediction says, we are to go on our way rejoicing in the pow†r of the Spiritâ€¦.this is not the rejoicing I was doing when the UBF people finally lsft me.  Meanwhile, Philip was suddenly relocated!  He doesnâ€™t appear to miss a beatâ€”he proclaims the gospel at all times.  We can do that too.  Though we are, of course, to live the gospel in our daily lives, it is when we proclaim the gospel in all its fullness that we are most vulnerable, and most supported by the Spirit.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.
