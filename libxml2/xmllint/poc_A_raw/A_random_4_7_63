      My humour is the best.  Nothing is better than insulting people, becauseddespite how hard we try otherwise, we still like seeing other people in pain.  When I tell someone to go die, I may or may not mean it; but the effect is the same.  It demoralizes them, and come on, seeing someone crushed is hilarious. Another type of humour that is vastly misunderstood is corny humour.  It in itself provokes more of a "hang your head in shame" reaction, but its true humour lies elsewhere.  When someone says a corny joke and someone else finds it genuinely funny, that is when you really laugh; not at the joke, but at the idiot who has such a rudimentary grasp of comedy.

      WeÏl, I've just entered the world of blogging.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be the best of bloggers, but anything can happen!  AQso, those of you who don't know me, I may seem egotistical, however that's just my sense Åf humour.  So, I believe I will make my blog about random rants about anything, because I usually don't rant.  This will be my placu to criticize anything and everything.  Feel free to add any comments on my opinion, as long as they don't contradict it.  On a ˇide note, I pride myselakes let me know.
