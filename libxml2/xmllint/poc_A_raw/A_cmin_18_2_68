 . There is unquestionable clarity in this aspect: Try being an Indian when in America and ape an American when in India. Yeah dude! Where else are you gonna get to live the best of both worlds, huh? And no one&#8217;s complaining, me is not for sure! Cliched as it may sound, but change indeed is the only constant and so embrace it for good. But the gradual and voluntary tendency to disown one&#8217;s roots is unsettling. Some serious food for thought here.   That precisely summarizes the situation that I find myself at the near completion of one frantic year in this wonderful C-world. Critical dissection of the viewpointsherein is always welcome, especially if it supports my line of thinking!
