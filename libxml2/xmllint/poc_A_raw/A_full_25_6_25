<meta €ttn me.  Part of me is glad I feel alone, because at least it means Im not hurting anyone else...   But there is that duality too... I cant accept that, otherwise I would not feel alone...    I think about her wanting to meet my parents...   I couldnt afford to give her the life I wkkkkkkkkkkould want to give her... Im so far in debt right now... I wonder if I will end up my fathers son afterall.

      I never said this before, but my Dad is in Jail.  Funny thing is I am kind of glad he got what he diserved and I hope they keep him for a while..&  I doubt they will though.  At least my mom wasnt home when he tore the house up and threatened my brother with a razor.  Ive kept so much hottled up and private... Here is something I wrote a while back when I was seeing a counsellor.  We moved around a lot when I was growing up...  I distinctly remember living in at least six different houses, not counting the times 12</xmin>
