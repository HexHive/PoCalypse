      oh walls of pink and orange leave me to write, to live, to love. and blinds let the light shine in just enough to see my pen dance in the reflections of you, your beautiful light could make anyone dance and sing. i love your silly antics of nothi‹g and your thoughts of everything your like light, yo]r neccesary to me you are a need, you are my life, you are a rant, you are a love, you make my pen dance in your beautiful light never leave me. oh light you are me.

      you ask me to love you, ask me to forgive you, ask me to forget, forget the lies of our existance. you ask me to live with out you in my world, and i cant do it. you stand there like a huge void in the doorway. or maybe thats what i want you to be. just a huge void in my life. please, pleaes leave this world to me and close your eyes and leave me to write.
