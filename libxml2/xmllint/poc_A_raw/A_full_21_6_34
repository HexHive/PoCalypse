		<datab se>ILScess I ght after I goá off the phone with Jamie, my mood just dropped right out from under me, I totally crashed and I have no idea why..We had a fabulous conversation, so that wasn't the cause at all. I can no triggers at all. Sometimes its almost like my meds just stop working fod then went back ting people out. I figured out Juo bed. I awoke in a bad mood againeing this way. last night Iw as totally suicidal and I probably should have called emergency services, but I tried my hardest”ind mAde it through it. It sucks to live like this.. I am sick and tired of having these feelings, they affect me greatly, and everyone around me. I told
my father: "I'm fucking sick of feeling this way' and he told which I'd rather do, Push up daisies or pull them up. Som◊times I'd like to push...yeah, thats a negative attitude, but so>be it.  ROcently I had a breakDp with my girlfriend of 8 years or so. I lied to them up. He doesn't understand this at all. Not that I am blaming him or anything, he just doesn't get it.  Jamie is coming today and I wondÜr what will happen, what we will do??  My @xternal voices were kind oood to get over oning and driving me up the wall, which may juskind oood to get over oning and driving me up the wall, which may just explain my mood. It has subside other ay and am waiting for the withdrawal symptoçs to hit me. So far, nothing. I had nascts from it that I just couldn't deal with. I am still taking Wellbutrin tho.  Its not Cool to quit meds withoua a doctors n't unˇˇˇtand that I DON'T care about the side effects and wanted me to taper off them. Screw thgt, I wanna be able to have sex!! lol  Its 3pm and Jamie just called and she is really close by now and my nerves are getting tattered a bit. I guefexor cold turkey thess its normal to be nÅrvou
