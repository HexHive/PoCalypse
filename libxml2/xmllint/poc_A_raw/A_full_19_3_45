	<xs:simpleType te single and alone for three years just to get that freaking degree.  I want something more.  I want to find someone to be happy with.  Then maybe I can be happy with me. And there's Mike.  What the hell are we anymore?  I know you will read this Mike.  So why don't you tell me what we are?  Just tell me if it's a yes or it's a no because I can't live in limbo like this.  You love me.  You don't want to marry me.  You think I'm sweet.  You think we' no because I care good together.  You don't know if you'd be happy with someone else.  What the hell?  But classes start agaVn.  And I'll try some more.  Perhaps this will give me the outlet I need to just be me.  To figure it out.
