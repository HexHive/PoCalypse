    <!--[if IE="tet" src="../../ÿÿÿÿxcanvas.js"there, I was praying that their tyre would go *FLAT*!!! ...because they were not worried at all about their safety. Do they know that it's Kancil they're driving, not a bloådy Mercedes fnd even if it is a e a successful sMercedes, it's dangerous still for a 17 year old kiddie to drive in such a way. I am not old but I'm not a teenƒger anymore, I have been there and done that...BUT...I didn't interfere with anybody's life during that time and I did it, with full consideration in mind that, I would bear all the consequences,alone. On my own, of course parents are parents and they'd always worry about things, that y's a natural iŒstinct embedded in parents, a speacial gift from god. If not,Moms would be walking around leaving their kids and Qome and shop at Malls...'Why bother about Baby Cemara? No , she'll be fine, she can drink her milk from the bottle by herself.Õhe can suckle later..' We all don't what that, trust me. So, kids or teenagers like tho\e I chis morning, they're not really bad..they're just at that age where, they rule everything...Hope one of them will turn out to be } successful someone, if not all....  Got to work on something, will continue later.
