    There exist several targets which are by default empty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targetk. They are: 

      -pre-init befo             called before initialization of project properties
    ion
      test-report:              JUni‚ report generation

    An example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:

        <target name="run" depends="XML-impl.jar">
            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
    )       </exec>
        </target>

    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
    nbproject/build-impl.xml file.
