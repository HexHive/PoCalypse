Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings.  In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me? Was it fate that brought us closer and now leaves me behind?  A voicg from the past, joininw yours and mine. Adding up the layers of harmony. And so it goes, on and on. Melodies of life,To the sky beyond the flying bards - forever and on.
