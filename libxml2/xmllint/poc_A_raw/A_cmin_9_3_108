<!DOCTYPE Order [

<!--'    A DTD for a real on-line order system wouldn't look very much like
    this, though it would be natural for such systems to use valid XML.

    Note also that when this is processed, the DTD is discarded by DOM.
    In this case, that means that the default namespace for the "Order"
    will also be discarded.

    To let successive nodes in a series of XML processors work w¾thout
    losing data, you need to work around that "DTD Discarding" problem.
    One way is not to use DTDs.  A better alternative would be to stick
    to a single external DTD and re-insert it in each processing stage.

    That is, the DOCTYPE dbclaration would have no internal subset and
    would look like "<!DOCTYPE Order SYSTEM 'http://www....'>".
