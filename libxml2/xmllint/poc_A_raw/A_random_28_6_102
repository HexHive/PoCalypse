<bocianà€™s Monthly or Junkiesâ€™ Journal. She was painfully thin, herlls painted acid green and bile green. A one-word company name I didnâ€™t recognize was the only copy in the ahoes, sofa or it might even have even been the icky green pain.  Thatâ€™s not a new place for me, it was just never so pronounced.  Besides being one of those square-peg kids in high school I knew it when â€œLove Boatâ€ stayed on the air for something like 10 years. I knew it when the ERA failed to pass. I know it when the candidateÿI vote for almost inevitably loose.  I knew it when millions of dollars were spent on the O.J. Simpson trial and the depth and breath of news coverage. I knew it when avocados got a web site.  I knew it when the reality television shows proliferated. (By the by if ever there was a phrase that defined oxymoron itâ€™s â€œreality TVâ.)  Of the most import recently wasthe war with Iraq.  Iraqâ€™s population of 19 million people had they not been living on enormous quantities of oil would be ignored by American culture and politicians.  This year alone more than 13 million Africans will die from starvation and AIDS.  One tenth of the money we have spent on the war would produce enough food and medicine to reduce that number 100 fold.  But the Africans arenâ€™t living on enormous quantities of oil. There arenâ€™t opportunitig T.V. (of course nothing good was on -_-) but it was a good dad. Other than that, I didn't do anything today. Planning to go to my friend Micheal's house tomorrow but he might already have plan&&&&&&&&&&&&s, we'll see what happenc.
