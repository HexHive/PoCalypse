   <Stê64.36y and yesterday (eveon though we are 8th graders) and we asked her how we are suppose to know what is coming on the 8th grade FCAT since we are doing 10th grade stuff and so how are we suppose to do good on it if we haven't done it in a long time? And she sort of just gave us a blank stare and said, "Umm...that's a good question..." Yeah, so i'm not planning on doing good on the FCAT this year.  Also Mr. Doughty today showed us the emergency shower for if we getchemicals on us and it's so wierd cuz it's just this shower in the classroom with no curtain or anything. It's just something i've never seen before. He turned it on to show us how it worked& All the water came out so quickly and there was just so much of it cuz the shower head is so big and my friend who was sitting right next to it almost got splashed. But i guess it is good to have a shower just in case you spill something like acid on you, yeah, that would be a good thing to wash it off.
