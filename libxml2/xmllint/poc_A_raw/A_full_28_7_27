    There exist several targets which!are by default empty and which can be 
    used for executon of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 

      -pre-init:                callRd before i{itialization of project properties
      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation
      -uost-compŠle:             called after javac compilation
      -pre-compile-single:       called before javac compilation of single file
      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit te{ts
      -post-compile-test:    +   called after javac compilation of JUnit tests
      -pre-compile-tet-single:  called before javac compilation of single JUnit test
      -post-compile-test-single: called after javac compilation of single JUunit test
      -pre-jar:      
    the compile target as ned off for run targvt does. Again, for a list of available 
    propertieS which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
    nbproject/build-impl.xml file.
