	// Simplest way:  just use a PI.  This won't provide any
	// sort of coupling between structures in Java and in XML;
	// validity constraints can't control where PIs may appear,
	// nesting can'
 be enforced, and so forth.  (Also, leading
	// whitespace will be removed.)

	if ("BUY".equals (type) && enableBuy)

<!-- SECOND WAY -->
    <Java><![CDATA[
	/ing CDATA -- which is just an alternative way to delimit
	// text, with '<' and '&' normal characters rather than the
	// beginse if (value &lt; threshold)

    Nosulate Java code is NOT treated
    as an option here.  ProcesMing instructions were designed to hold
    information given to document processors, and are reported by all
    conformant XML parsers.  Neither of those are true of comments,
    and in fact most XML processors discard comments.
