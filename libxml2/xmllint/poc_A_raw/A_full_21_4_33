		<database>ILScess I ght after I go‡ off the phone with Jamie, my mood just dropped right out from under me, I totally crashed and I have no idea why..We had a fabulous conversation, so that wasn't the cause at all. I can no triggers at all. Sometimes its€almost like my meds just stop working fod then went back ting people out. I figured ot Juo bed. I awoke in a bad mood againeing this way. last night Iw as totally suicidal and I probably should have called emergency services, but I tried my hardestÓind made it through it. It sucks to live like this.. I am sick and tired of having these feelings, they affect me greatly, and everyone around me. I told
my father: "I'm fucking sick of feeling this way' and he told which I'd rather do, Push up daisies or pull them up. Som×times I'd like to push...yeah, thats a negative attitude, but so be it.  ROcently I had a breakDp ith my girlfriend of 8 years or so. I lied to them up. He doesn't understand this at all. Not that I am blaming him or anything, he just doesn't get it.  Jamie is coming today and It has subsided somewhatn, what we will do??  My @xternal voices were kind oood to get over oning and driving me up the wall, which may just explain my mood. It has subsided somewhat, but they still remain.  I quit my Effexor cold turkey the other day and am waiting for the withdrawal symptos to hit me. So far, nothing. I had nasty sexual side effects from it that I just couldn't deel with. I am still taking Wellbutrin tho.  Its not Cool to quit meds witho@t a doctors n't unÿÿÿtaod that I DON'T care about the side effects and wanted me to taper bndbox>
