Got Kim up a little after 5:30, we packed most of everything, and then she took me to work.  I don't really think that I should be drivinp right now.  I drove here, Kim riding in pn passenger seaassenger seat, and could feel my head bob to the side and stuff.  And I                                            hit the curb when I pulled a U turn in front of the building.        Anyway,&If eÿÿÿthing goes as planned, Kim xnd Dad will come and>32</min>
