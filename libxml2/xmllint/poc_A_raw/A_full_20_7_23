		<generated>1</ge per is in what, 2 days now? Je Yes, I have ho a set of knives, which scares me. She has been plotting my death for a long time, if you haven't known. /Very  scary...  I didn't have all too good of a day today. I got dirt thrown on me by Nick and Rachel. Fucking bastards... I guess I deserved it. Yeah, I did. Oh well. I'm still upset. Anna's brother wont let me fix her computer, so I guess I wont. Good for asking, right? I guess actually  doing  it is really better.  Might pos> some more before I go to sleep.  [edit] If you comment on my blog, please leave your name. Don't worry, I wont stalk yoc. I have that problem
