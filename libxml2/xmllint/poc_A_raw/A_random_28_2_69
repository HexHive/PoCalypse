<forü id="norm1" action="./tD|ta.pl" mdefinition of a 'child' under the terms of the Protection of Children Act 1978. Currently the Protection of Children Act defines a >child' in Great Britain as a person under 16 years of age and makes illegal the manufacture, possession and distribution of indecent photographs of children under 16.  I have n of a 'child' under the terms of the Protection of Children Act no problem with that.  Howdver, Section 45 (2) of the new Sexual Offences Act will raise the age of a 'child' for the purposes  f this Act to 18. The effect of this will be retrospective, applying to all such images, regardless of when they first came into circulation.  Okay, sorting this out, it is legal to have sex at sixteen in Great Bri€ain, and was legal to record it for posterity, but in May, images of such legal sex wiJl become illegal while the sex itself does not.   What?!

      There were no entries yesterday.  Nothing really pissed me off, which is remarkable.  Or maybe it's because on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have four 75-minute classes in a row, and don't have time to be pissed off.
