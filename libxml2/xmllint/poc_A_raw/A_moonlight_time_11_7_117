<?pitar>xMla  !D[1`DATA , if you like it tell me so... Well, here it is... It doesn't have a title...  To all my friends I wanu you to know I love you all So never let go  To all the guys Who said they cared I want you to see How well I've fared  To my family Who I hold so dear I hope to hear from you Yend Thank you so much I'd of never had fun Without seeing you at lunch  To my best man I love you the most I'd follow you From east to west coast  And to myself I'm glads complain and argue over their friends and who they like and who they don't and who they are going to talk to. No! I will not take part in any of this. I refuse to be part of their problems in any way. The only thing I will do is be there for them when they need a shoulder to cry on, Give them advice when they need it, and show them that I love them. I wish someone cared about me, listened to my problems the wayI listen to theirs. Someone who will do the same for me as I do for them...  I feel hurt to think that my friend thinks that I value winning a competition over her friendship. Well, to tell you the truth Jessica I value our friendship more...  And Tricia pick a guy that you really like and stick to him. One that isn't going to cheat obutJ dia:name="bordFr_color">
