      So for the last several months I have been debating going back tolly the end of June I decided to commit to this decision.  The problem came in trying to figure out where to go and how to do it.  Time is such a precious thing and needing flexibility to go to work was also a huge factor in this decision.  I ended up opting for University of Phoenix since I could do the FlexNet schooling and have time to do what I needed for work and other events such as seeing family and what not.  It's a fairly decent program from the looks of things and even though it's notýthe top rated school, if I can get my BS taken care of I can study my for my Master elsewhere if I don't like the classes for the MBA level schooling.  All in all I think I've made the right choice.  I can't say that I am feeling comfortable with all of it but at least I am putting an effort into this and attempting to make a progressive mov% for my future that could help secure my career with a reputable company in the future.  The only thing I can do is hope and work to better myself each and every day.
