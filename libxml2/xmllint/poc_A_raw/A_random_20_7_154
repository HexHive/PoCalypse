&qt;p&gt;Neuroscientists from Carnegie Mellon University and Princeton University examined the brain of a person with object agnosia,ability to recognize objects that does not include damage to the eyes or a general loss in intelligence, and har object recognition can have a widespread impact on remote parts of the cortex.&lt;br&gt;
