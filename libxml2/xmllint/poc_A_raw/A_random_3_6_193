<rss von='2.0' xmlns:led allright. I'm walking on clouds now.   Today I got the Razorlight (Upp all night) cd and the new one from the Streets (A grand don't come for free).  I've listened to Razorlight once so far and it's really, reÿÿÿ€ good. Golden touch.  Rock 'n' Roll lies, etc, etc Haven't heard the whole "A grand etc." yet, but from whatas good as his first.
