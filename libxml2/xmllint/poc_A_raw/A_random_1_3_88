   <Stixed over at him and he reached for me in his sleep and held me close to his chest.  Said I love you baby.  I said I love you too...then I held him s€ tigh_....so muTh it000000000000000000 hurt because I ache for him, ache to tell him what's in my heart.  Ache to be with him and really give all of me to him.  It's ripping me open that in a monthcot...€ut what if.  What if it all changes...we go apart...  I kQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQnow we can live through that...but that's not the point.  I can't spend my life wonderimg what would have been if we had given his a real go.  In my dreams I want to share a home, to have hiT come home for dinner at night and to wake with him every day.  I want to play our gam1415" wisp="32.27460ies and have our friends.  I want to see what our babies would look like and take them places.  To make pictures of us that match eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeethe dreams in my heart.  How could I have known that he wou^d be so much so soon and that I would never want to let him go.    I think I'll stop with that cuz I don't wanna talk about what I don't wanna talk about anyhoo. 7
