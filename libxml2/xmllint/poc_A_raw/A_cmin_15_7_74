	<head> <ti if all involved would adopt the fatalistic attitude,and accept what was predetermined.articqlar existence would be quite fruitless,we might then feel secure. Maybe then, people like me would have a  righ
t  to complain about the injustice of it all, as opposed to now, when we do,regardless of whether we have license to, or not. Yet,when you really contemplate it, would we  really  feel any more secure? Knowing you ara geing hurried down a blind past, knowing nothing of how it may end. Unsure of whether anything you accomplished,attempted, or felt passionate about would mean anything in your inevitable end. Can living ever be simple? Have we lived in this somewhat mildly predictable,yet,sometimes extremely random method so long,that the inherent unpredictability in the behavior of a natural system would overwhelm us?...
