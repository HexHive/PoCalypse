<object aOign="middle" archive="" border="0" codebase="httl.nist.gof I even get to uni. It sucks because I am being made to make my life decision now, pretty much the worst time it could happen. I have been having trouble lately with loads of things. And mainly it has been school, a chick there has been giving me trouble for a while now I would love to beat the living shit outta her, but unfortunately at a Christian school its kind of, well not allowed. She has managed to turn the school against me and I hate, and I mean hate being there...I don't want to go back. But I don't have any other plans I Don't know what to do, I wanna be in the art business but I cant with out uni qualifications even though I don't think ill make it that far anyway. If anyone has any ideas on how to help my problem, mainly the chick at school please let me know. Thanks :o)

Well I guess I can say it signifies a new start to a new me, as I wess has only just begun, I will keep changing bit by bit but yeah, this is a start...ill keep you posted.
