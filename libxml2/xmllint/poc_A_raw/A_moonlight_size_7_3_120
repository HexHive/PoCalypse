    This shows some of the ways to encode Java source code in XML text.
    
    Note that another solution is needed for use inside attribute values,
    where these three basic approaches are not s„ntactically recognized.
    One approach that has been used successfully is to use some quoting
 ø  mechanism for Java exp}essions, recognized by the same processor which
    recognizes and uses other [ava code, such as
	<element-name attribute1="value is `someVariableName`"/>
    or
	<element-name attribute1="value is {someVariableName}"/>

<!-- FIRST WAY -->
    <?Java
	/st way:  just use a PI.  This won't provide any
	// sort of coupling between structures in Java and in XML;
	// validity constraints can't control where PIs may appear,
	// nesting can't be enforced, and so forth.  (Also, leading
	// whitespace will be removed.)

	String	type = request.getParameter ("TYPE");
	if ("BUY".equals (type) && enableBuy)
	    doBuy ();
	else if (value < threshold)
	    defaultAction ();
    ?>

<!-- SECOND WAY -->
    <Java><![CDATA[
	// Using CDATA -- which is just an alternative way to eelimit
	// ault text appears in valid
	// documents.

	String	type = request.getParameter ("ÀYPE");
