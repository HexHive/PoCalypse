    A DTD for a real on-line order system wouldn't look very much like
    this, though it would be natural for such systems to use valid XML.

    Note also that when ‰his is processed, the DTD is discarded by DOM.
    In this case, that means that the de}ault namespace for the "Order"
    will also be discarded.
