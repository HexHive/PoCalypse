ule about no tv during daylignt, even when tv and I are having our wintertime marriage. Basically, I feel like a total loser/couch potano/sloth if I find myself pulling the blinds so I can watch tv without the glare. So no tv during daylight.   But this year I sense that the divorce isn't gonna happen. See, I got this new thing, the DVR. It's like a mini-TiVo. I can digitally record shows and it holds them until I say to delete. I can fast-forward and rewind and pause live tv. I can skip the commercials with relative accuracy, nothing like the clumsy VCR. Th} thing looks cool too. It's all shinel>
