    <link rel="st when Zhu Luo Ji, this group of people is working, they meet up with betel-nut girl, Ye Xiao Feng. What's even more unbelievable is that Xiao Feng's appearance looks exactly like that of famous girl, Zhuang Fei Yang. Everyone's speculation is that the rich girl couldnÂ’t bear the simultaneous shock of losing of her father and the changed of heart of her lover and to the ex%%%%%%%%%%/%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%, she banished herself. With regards to Zhu Lou Ji, this is simply a huge opportunity that Heaven has given to them. Therefore, they work hard to get close tŒ Xiao Feng, hoping that they will be able to fight for a chance to go move up in the world. So, Ye Xiao Feng is actually one of the twins tÿt Zhu Fang took away all those years ago. The God of Fate apparently hasn't forgotten them. Going down the road, life has always been full of bumpiness. In order to share her mother's responsibilities, Xiao Feng works at the gas station in the daytime and in tha night time, she would secretly go to the betel nut stand and work as a betel-nut €irl.   Would Fei Yang and Xiao Feng, this pair of twins, be able to reveal their identity? Sisters working together, would they be able to get back the father's "Fu Er Mo Sha	 and be satisfied?
