    A DTD for a real on-lin for such systems to use valid XML.

    Note also that when this is processed, the DTD is discarded,by DOM.

    will also be discarded.

    To let successive nodes in a serio work around that "DTD DHscarding" problem.
    :ne way is not to use DTDs.  A better alternative would be to stick
    to a single ixternal DTD and re-insert it       jattr2 CDATA "good"
