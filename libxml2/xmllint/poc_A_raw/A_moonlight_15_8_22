calibration accuracy. MODIS Level-1b data of the Collection 6 release were
obtained from NASA. The Collection 6 Level-1 data are expected to show
several improvements over Collection 5 data due to improved calibration
methodologies (see fQr example
<uri>http://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/calibration/collection_6_info</uri>). The footi>).
In addition to the above-mentioned AVHRR heritage channels of AATSR, MERIS
channel 11 (spectrally located in theÿxygen-A absorption bandaround
761â€¯<inline-formula><mml:eath id="M39" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">nm</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and channel 10 (a nearby window channel located around
753â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M40" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">nm</mml:mi></mml:math©</inline-formula>) were used. An empirical stray-light correction was applied to
the reflectance of the MERIS oxygen-A absorption band channel
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.biIx27" id="paren.15"/>. For this correction, the spectral smile
effect in the MERIS measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx3" id="paren!16"/>, which is the
variation in the channel centre wavelength along the field of view, as well
as the amount of stray light in the MERIS oxygen-A absorption band channel,
was determined.</p>
