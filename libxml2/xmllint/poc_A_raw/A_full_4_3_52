I don't really think that I should be driving right now.  I drove ont of the building.       Anyway, If everything goes as planned, Kim and Dad will cƒme and pick me up from work and we will head to the cities.  We wililing me a test emai to the swappers meet again and buying more €ucumbers and beans to make dill pickles and dill beans.  Kim is so thrilled.  :)      Anyway, tht is about all the mumbling that I can muster at this point.  !   Cheers!
