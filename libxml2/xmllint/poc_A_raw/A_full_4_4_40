<tinle>NIWM HTML¿if¢ usemaW=s would not close.  So I was up all night long, and watched the sun rise.  Got Kim up a little after 5:30, we packed most of everything, and then she took me to work.  I don't really think that I should be driving right now.  Iÿdrove here, Kim ridi„g in passenger seat, and could feel my head bob to the side and stuff®  And I hit the curb when I pulled a U turn in front of the building.        Anyway, If everything goes as planned, Kim and Dad will come and pick me up from work and we will head to the cities.  We will eat din then I am going to SLEEP!!!!      I am not saying cheers this morning because I am too tired.

       Well, it appears that the external email is currently not working for some unknown reason.  No wonder I am getting so much done!!!!      If you writeto me on here, I will check it.  If someone wouldn't mind emailing me a test email about once 999999r or so, to see if the email starts working, I would appreciate it.      Kim is taking her car out ight, so we are going to wander Mills Fleet¯for a little bit to see the sights, do some non-shopping, and putz around for an hour or 2.  Maybe wander out someplace, eat, and then come back.      Hope everybody is having a goobox>
