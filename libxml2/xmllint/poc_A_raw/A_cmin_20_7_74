    For list of available properties check the imy are: 

      -pre-init:        example of overriding the target for project execution could look like this:

        <target name="run" depends="XML-impl.jar">
            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.xe">
                <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
            </exec>
        </target>

    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
    properties which you can use, check the target you are overriding in the
    nbproject/build-impl.xml file.
