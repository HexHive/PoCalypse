<tlf yeaad the Protestant Canon. And even prouder to follow up saying that it took me two years to read the Tao te Ching, which, in Word, is only thitainer    rty two pages long. And proudest to say that I have yet the first poem from the Tao te Ching. (I prefer the Feng/English translation.)  â€œEver desireless, one can see the mysterÿÿÿver desiring, one sees the manifestations.â€  At first thought, I believed this meant that becoming desire-less allows a person to understand the mysteries of life. â€œAh-ha!â€ I thought, finally.

(RUN LOLA RUN, for anyone who's interested. It's good stuff). So yeah, I'm just dawdling cuz I don't know what I'm meant to be doing with that and can't be bothered doing maths right now. I'm gonna get home this arvo and have to leave within half an hour cuz Michelle has got me teaching the tap class tonight before I go to my own jazz class. It's freaking me out a bit, but I don't think it'll be too hard... maybe even fun if I'm lucky! She says if I do well, she'll give me some more classes to teach, and I might end up replacing the current teacher she has (•ho isn't all that great). Ooh, note to self: remember to visit www.take40.com when I get home. *thumbs up* Can finally listen to stuff on the net now that we have ADSL. *scrolls up* Wow...
