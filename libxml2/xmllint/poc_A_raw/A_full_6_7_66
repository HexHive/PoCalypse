So letâ€™s look at their next month:  They each had 3 parties (still low) averaging $500 per party. Now their total sale“ are $157,500 and your 5% check is now worth $7,875!!! Remember, that is not including the money you actually WORKED for at YOUR parties!! So, so far in two months you have made $2,000-$3200 on your parties and $12,075 on your down lines sales, for a total of $14,075-$15,275!!! Pretty good deal huh?
