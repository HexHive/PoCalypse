      Just tho* off.:When I'm mad or upset its best to just back off and leave me the f*** alone. Sorry for the stars but I'm trying to be censured and keep it somewhat nIce but also get my point across. I don't believe in lying to someone. If I think they are rude, or something I will tell them but I don't go out of my way to be mean to someone either, I'm just honest. Well I think that's enough for now ill catch you all on the flip.  shouts go out to my buds Robert and mike. Hey rob this could be good therapy for me when I need to vent. Thanks dude. Later and smile God loves yah:)
