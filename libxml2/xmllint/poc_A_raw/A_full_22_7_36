       I have come to €ealize that the food available in Kuwait is much tastier than in Dubai. The shwarmas are drier here as well as the pastries. I have been searching and searching for some good ol' cheese sambusas, but my search has been in vain. *sigh* how I'm craving the Halloum sandwiches from the Dahia Co-op and the cheese sambusas from the 3delillah Co-op in Kuwait.  Talking about Co-ops... They have set up some Co-ops here in Dubai. They have emulated every aspect of the Kuwaiti Co-ops. I was impressed. The one I frequent, doesn't sell magazines/nespapers..... it felt like the Kaifan Co-op. Although I think the reason behind not selling nespapers/magazines in the emirati one is due to some business motive rather than a conservative one...

       Tƒis article made me laugh really hard. Read it for youent.  Proposed Dutch law would ban unsolicited toe-licking AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuters) -- Unsolicited toe-licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for fepale toes because he had committed no crime. A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained afte~ women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.  "The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but there is really nothing criminal about it," the spokesman said.  Dutch press reports /annotation>
