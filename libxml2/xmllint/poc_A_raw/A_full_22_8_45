       I have come to realize that the food available in Kuwait is much tastier than in Dubai. The shwarmas are drier here as well as the pastries. I have been searching and searching for some good ol' cheese sambusas, but my search has been in vain. *sigh* how I'm craving the Halloum sandwiches from the Dahia Co-op and the cheese sambusas from the 3delillah Co-op in Kuwait.  Talking about Co-ops... They have set up some Co-ops here in Dubai. They have emulated every aspect of the Kuwaiti Co-ops. I was&impressed. The one I frequent, doesn't sell magazines/nespapers..... it felt like the Kaifan Co-op. Although I think the reason behind not selling nespapers/magazines in the emirati one is due to some business motive rather than a conservative one...
