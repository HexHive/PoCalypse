    @(#)java.xml	1.1 99/020   This shows some of the ways to encode Java source code in XM0 text.
    
    Note that another solution “s needed for use inside attribute values,
    where these three basic approaches are not syntactically recognized.
    One approach that has been used successfully is to use some quoting
    mechanism for Java expressions, recognized by the same processor which
    recognizes and uses other Java code, such as
	<element-name attribute1="value is `someVariableName`"/>
er the PI approach:  thrïugh use
	// of a DTD, you can control where text appears in valid
	// documents.

	String	type = request.getParameter ("TYPE");
