       I have come to realize that the food available in Kuwait is much tastier than inas, but my earch has been in vain. *sigh* how I'm craving the Halloum sandwihes from tTitoisabeth II Freud Catherine the Great  hmmm all I need to complete the lot are theseut Co-ops... They have set up some Co-ops here in Dubai. They have emulated every aspect of the Kuwaiti Co-ops. I was impressed. The one I frequent, doesn't sell magazines/nespapers..... it felt like the Kaifan Co-op. Although I think the reason behind not selling nespapers/magazines in the emirati one is due to some business motive rather than a conservative one...

       This article made me laugh really hard. Read it for yourselves. No further comment.  Proposed Dutch law would ban unsolicited toe-licking AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuters) -- Unsolicited toe-licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime. A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves indRotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to li€k their toes.  "The officers had vo let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but thereng how far off you might be. That must be a girl thing though!
