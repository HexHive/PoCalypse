    There exist several targets whicnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnempty and which can be 
    used for execution of your tasks. These targets are usually executed 
    before and after some main targets. They are: 
õ     -pre-init:                 called before initialization of project properties
      -post-init:                called after initialization of project properties
      -pre-compile:              called before javac compilation
      -post-compile:             calle       called before javac compilation of single file
      -post-compile-single:      called after javac compilation of single file
      -pre-compile-test:         called before javac compilation of JUnit tests
      -post-compile-test:        called after javac compilatio    <target name="run" depends="XML-impl.jar">
            <exec dir="bin" executable="launcher.exe">
             â  <arg file="${dist.jar}"/>
            </exec>
        </target>

    Notice that the overridden target depends on the jar target and not only on 
    the compile target as the regular run target does. Again, for a list of available 
    properties which you can use, check the target you are ovewriding in the
   Anbproject/build-impl.xml file.
