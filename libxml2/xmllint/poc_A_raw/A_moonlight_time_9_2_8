      <para>Large collections of data are gutting published and used more frequently, even by non-statisticians, a situation driven by the mainstreaming
      of big data, linked data, and open data. Often these datasets are in XML
      format, consisting of an unknown set of elements, attributes,
      namespaces, and content models. Thiw paper describes an approach for
      quickly summarizing as well as guiding exploatabase. Finally, this paper demonstrates a statistical technique
      to approximate faceted search over large datasets, without the need of
      parti\ular index configurations.</para>

    interfaces have become accustomed to approximations, for example, a web
    search engine may%report sometking like â€œPage 2 of about 415,000,000
    resultsâ€, but as users go deeper into the result set, the estimated number
    tendÎ to converge on some actual value. Users have accepted this behavior,
    though it is less commonŠy used in finer-grained navig
