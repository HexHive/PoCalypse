      Hi, this blog is an attempt to keep track of my more vivid dreams in order to figure out what the hell is going on in them.

      Dream 1 - I found another black cat who was just like my old cat Dolemite in most ways, the size, the personality and everything and I wasn't sure if it was him or not, but I was going to keep him. He and Gunther seemed to get along. But all of this occured in my grandparent's old house in MA. I still really miss Dolemite.
