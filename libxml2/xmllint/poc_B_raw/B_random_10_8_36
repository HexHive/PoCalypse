I don't like crowds or alot of people, that's why I mostly stay home to avoid people or crowds. Thank goodness my hubby's the same way. Though I do get cabin fever now and then and have to get out but not often. Well not really much else going on in this dead end town. We have a family reunion to go to in the morning after church and it will be ok as long as my sister in law doesnt show up. She could make the sunshine run away. She's a real witch and tht's putting it mildly. I need to get some letters written before bed so I'd better say bye' for now. Ya all take care and stay sweet. Kudo's out to my buds, Elfsong &amp; G

      Just thought id give this a try. I'm not good at putting my thoughts or whatever on paper and then letting other folks read them but hey I figured what the heck I'll give it the once around. Any how, I'd like to just say that its nice knowing everybody and I would like to tell you about my sweet hubby Jason. We met when I worked at shell 4 years ago and have been together ever since. Not even his family has been able to seperate us and they have tried one way or another but they would swear that they didn't try. (ha-ha) I've been in foster homes all my life until I was 16 so I can spot liars and creeps a mile away and believe me I don't trust any one but Jason nor do I like very many people because I have found that most people don't mean what they say and are just waiting for a chance to stab you in the back. I cant stand people who say they will do something and then don't or say they will help you and then don't. I also don'o be used. Boy does that tick me off. I hate helping someone do something but then when I need help or something they all of a sudden have something else to do or they got go somewhere. So you know what I say? Well I cant say what I want to cause it'd aint ret but not often. Well not really much else going on in this dead end town. We have a family reunion to go tits going to cost them. I aint nobody's maid or slave. I am Native American and I have a very hard head, I'm sRubborn and will argue with you in a heartbeat if I know I'm right or p***** off. When I'm mad or upset its best to just back off and leave me the f*** alone. Sorry for the stars but I'm trying to be censured and keep it somewhat nice but also get my point across. I don't believe in lying to someone. If I think they are rude, or something I will tell them but I don't go out of my way to be mean to someone either, I'm just honest. Well I think that's enough for now ill catch you all on the flip.  shouts go out to my buds Robert and mike. Hey rob this could be good therapy for me when I need to vent. Thanks dude. Later and smile God loves yah:)
