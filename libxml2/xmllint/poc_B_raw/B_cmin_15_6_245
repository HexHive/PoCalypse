      <abstract>
    <p id="d1e348">New cloud property datasets based on measurements from the passive
imaging satellite sensors AVHRR, MODIS, ATSR2, AATSR and MERIS are presented.
Two retrieval systems were developed that include components for cloud
detection and cloud typing followed by cloud property retrievals based on the
optimal estimation (OE) technique. The OE-based retrievals are applied to
simultaneously retrieve cloud-top pressure, cloud particle effective radius
and cloud optical thickness using measurements at visible, near-infrared and
thermal infrared wavelengths, which ensures spectral consistency. The
retrieved cloud properties are further processed to derive cloud-top height,
cloud-top temperature, cloud liquid water path, cloud ice water path and
spectral cloud albedo. The Cloud_cci products are pixel-based retrievals,
daily composites of those on a global equal-angle latitudeâ€“longitude grid,
and monthly cloud properties such as averages, standard deviations and
histograms, also on a global grid. All products include rigorous propagation
of the retrieval and sampling uncertainties. Grouping the orbital properties
of the sensor families, six datasets have been defined, which are named
AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, ATSR2-AATSR and MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR,
each comprising a specific subset of all available sensors. The individual
characteristics of the datasets are presented together with a summary of the
retrieval systems and measurement records on which the dataset generation
were based. Example validation results are given, based on comparisons to
well-established reference observations, which demonstrate the good quality
of the data. In particular the ensured spectral consistency and the rigorous
uncertainty propagation through all processing levels can be considered as
new features of the Cloud_cci datasets compared to existing datasets. In
addition, the consistency among the individual datasets allows for a
potential combination of them as well as facilitates studies on the impact of
temporal sampling and spatial resolution on cloud climatologies.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="d1e406">Satellite-based datasets of geophysical variables are crucial for climate
research as they represent observations of the Earth's climate system, which
can be used for both the analysis of the climate and its variability as well
as guidance for atmospheric model developments. These datasets evolve
periodically by mainly two activities: (1)Â extending and improving the
underlying radiance record by adding new satellite recordings and applying
new inter-calibration to the entire record, and (2)Â the development and
application of more advanced retrieval systems and the utilization of
additional or more frequent auxiliary data which often undergo regular
updates themselves.</p>
      <p id="d1e409">In the last few decades, activities to process and reprocess global,
high-quality cloud property datasets based on long-term satellite measurement
records have been undertaken with increased effort. The backbone of most of
the multi-decadal climate datasets of cloud properties has been the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Operational Environmental
Satellites (POES) series. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) has been on board the NOAA satellites since the end of the 1970s
(i.e. NOAA-5 and beyond). AVHRR is a passive imaging sensor, where the source
of measured radiation is not emitted by the instrument. Instead, the upwards
reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation is measured at the top of the
atmosphere (TOA). This is done in abutting piŽels that assemble a seamless
image. With its four to six spectral channels, AVHRR allows the rKtrieval of
key cloud properties. AVHRR has been a significant contributor to many global
cloud climatologies, e.g. the International Satellite Cloud Climatology
