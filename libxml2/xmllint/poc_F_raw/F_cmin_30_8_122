                                                             Changes from version 3.3  
                                                         *************************************

1.   <form> as sublement of <location><holdingsSimple><copyInformation> is changed to conform to the <form> element defined for the MODS namespace.  The effect of this change is attribute ID is now allowed for <form>. Since it is optional this will not affect existing instances.  

2. The attribute 'displayLabel' has been added to the definitions of several top level elements, so that all top level elements now have this attribute. Specifically 'displayLabel' has been added to the definitions of: <extension>, <genre>, <location>, <language>, <name>, <originInfo>, <part>, <physicalDescription>, <recordInfo>, <subject>, <targetAudience>, <typeOfResource>.   

3. Element <scriptTerm> is defined, a subelement of <language>, with attributes type (code or text) and authority. 

4. The languageAttributeGroup (lang, xml:lang, script and transliteration) now applies to every text element.  This is accomplished by use of the newly defined  "xsString" type, replacing the assignment of "xs:string" wherever applicable, that is, everywhere xs:string was previously used except to define an attribute or as the base of an extension for a definition with enumerated values.     In addition it has been added to top level elements <language>, <location>, and <part>; all other top level element already had these attributes in version 3.3 so now all top level elements have them. 

5. Values  "references"  and  "reviewOf" are added to attribute "type" of  <relatedItem>.   

6. The values "single unit", "multipart monograph", "serial", "integrating resource" are added to <originInfo><issuance>.  

7. Attribute ""shareable" is defined and added to <tableOfContents> and <abstract>.  It has a single value: "no" . 

8. Attribute ""supplied" is defined and added to  <originInfo><edition>, <originInfo><place>, <originInfo><publisher>, <physicalDescription><extent>, and <titleInfo>.  It has a single value: "yes" . 

9. For dates, "edtf" and "temper" are added to the list values that may be used for the "encoding" attribute. 

10. The version attribute now enumerates all 3.x versions (3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4). In earlier versions of the schema, only the latest version was allowed. (E.g. in version 3.3, the only allowable value for the version attribute was "3.3".) 

11. For the type attribute for <name>, the value "family" is added to the list of possible values. 

12. New attributes authorityURI and valueURI are defined, type xs:anyURI, identifying a controlled vocabulary and a value from that vocabulary, respectively.    These two attributes are applied to:
        (a) any element that already had an authority attribute in 3.3: 
              descriptionStandard, frequency, recordContentSource, roleTerm,  classification, Form, targetAudience, genre,
              physicalLocation, name, subject, titleInfo, geographicCode, placeTerm, languageTerm.   
         (b) new elemends that have an authority attribute:  scriptTerm
         (c) all subelements of <subject>.

13. New attribute altRepGroup added to all MODS top level elements, except relatedItem.  This is to support encoding of translations and transliterations of the same content. Thus identical values of this attribute occuring on different instances of the same top level element indicates that they contain the same content in a different language or transliteration.  

14. New attribute 'nameTitleGroup' defined for <titleInfo> and <name>. When the value of 'nameTitleGroup' for a specific instance of <titleInfo> equals the value of 'nameTitleGroup' for a specific instance of <name> then those instances are considered to be in the same name/title group. 

15. The 'usage' attribute, which had applied only to <url> (of <location>) in 3.3, now applies also to <titleInfo>, <name>, <typeOfResource>, <language>, <subject>, <classification>,  and <genre> in 3.4.  Previously, it had a single value, "primary display", for <url>. Now, when used with these new elements, there is a single value, "primary".  For <url>, both "primary display" and "primary" are allowed but "primary display" is depricated. 

16. The schema is rewritten in namespace-normalized form, and the definitions and sections are reorganized.

This forms the basis of the mods record definition, and also relatedItem. The difference between a MODS record and a relatedItem (as they pertain to their usage of the group definition) is that mods requires at least one element and relatedItem does not. The group definition is used by both, where relatedItem says minOccurs="0" and for the mods record definition minOccurs="1" (default).
