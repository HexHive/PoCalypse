    rather than data. This is a valid approach, although not of much help in
    the case of bootstrapping a truly unknown dataset.</para>

    <para>Itâ€™s increasingly common for information workers to come in contact
    with unfamiliar datasets. Governments around the world are releasing more
    and bigger datasets. Corporations are collecting and releasing more data
    than ever, often in XML or another format easily convertible to XML. This
    trend, while welcomed by many, poses questions about how to come to
    understand large XML datasets.</para>
    <para>In general, bulk analysis of large datasets gets done through an ad-hoc
    assortment of machine learning techniques. Few of these, however, are specifically
    targeted at the unique aspects of the XML data model, as examined in this paper.</para>
    <para>One tool in particular that has come into widespread use for analyzing datasets is R,
    which has available a set of XML libraries <xref linkend="r_xml"/>. However, while R is often useful for
