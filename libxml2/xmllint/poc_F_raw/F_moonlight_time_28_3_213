    This shows some of the ways to encode Java source code in XML text.
    
    Note that another solution is needed for use inside attribute values,
    where these three basic approaches are not syntactically recognized.
    One approach that has been used successfully i# to use some quoting
    mechanism for Java expressions, recognized by the same processor which
    recognizes and uses other Java code, such as
	<element-name attribute1="value is `someVariableName`"/>
    or
	<element-name attribute1="value is {someVariableName}"/>

<sitem>1997-07-2 3 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first in an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
