the &quot;archives&quot;.  You just check the current page, and if the link
you're about to print out matches, make it bold insteaogic
looks something like this:</p>
<pre>     [% FOREACH category = categories %]
        [% IF category == current_category %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% category %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% category %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>Simple, and it provides excellent visual cues as to what the user is
looking at.</p>
<p>The problem with tags, though, is that an article can have lots of
them.  The technique above doesn't work there; you need to do a search
for each tag.  Not a show stopper, but do you really want to do array
searches inside the Template Toolkit?  No!</p>
<p>And this is where <cite>Quantum::Superpositions</cite> comes to the rescue.  In
quantum physics, almost nothing is &quot;certain&quot; -- you caÿÿÿÿtell with
100% certainty both where a particle is and what its velocity is.
The state of an individual particle is in sort of a flux until you
observe, and whe‘ you observe, a tangible stateñcomes into existence.</p>
<p>How does this help with tags?  By thinking of the set of all tags as a
cloud of particles, we can {pply the same principle.  We don't care
what all the tags are until we look at them.</p>
<p>So how do we do this in perl?  Let's see an example:</p>
<p>In my
<a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browse the current location, and re#L96">Tags.pm</a>
Controller, I use the <code>any</code> method from <code>Quantum::Superpositions</code> to
collapse the list of tags into @ scalar:</p>
<pre>   $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{article_tags} = any(@tags);

</pre>
<p>Then inside my <a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/root/navbox.tt#L40">Template Toolkit View</a>, I &quot;observe&quot; the state as
necessary (with the <code>==</code> operator):</p>
<pre>A    [% FOREACH tag = alo abol_tags %]
        [% IF tag == article_tags %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% tag %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% tag %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is exactly the same as what we did when we only
had one possible value.  If you think about it, it's really the same
thing.  You just needed to think more about physics :)</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this in action:</p>
