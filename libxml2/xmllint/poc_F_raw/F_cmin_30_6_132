        <para>
          The GNOME Documentation Project (GDP) aims to provide GNOME
          and GNOME applications with a complete, intuitive, and clear
          documentation system.  At the center of the GDP is the
          <application>GNOME Help Browser</application>, which
          presents a unified interface to GNOME-specific documentation
          as well as other Linux documentation such as man pages and
          texinfo documents. The GNOME Help System provides a
          comprehensive view of documentation on a machine by
          dynamically assembling the documentation of GNOME
          applications and components which are installed. The GDP is
          responsible for writing numerous GNOME-related documents,
          both for developers and for users.  Developer documentation
          includes <ulink url="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/"
          type="http">APIs for the GNOME libraries</ulink>, <ulink

       <title>Joining the GDP</title>
       <para>
         Documenting GNOME and all the numerous GNOME applications is
         a very large project.  The GDP is always looking for people
         to help write, update, and edit documentation.  If you are
         interested in joining the GDP team, you should join the
         <ulink url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/">
         <citetitle>gnome-doc-list mailing list</citetitle> </ulink>.
         Read <xref linkend="gettingstarted" />, for help selecting a
         project to work on.  Feel free to introduce yourself on the
         gnome-doc-list mailing list and indicate which project you
         intend to work on, or else ask for suggestions of important
         documents which need work done. You may also want to join the
         #docs IRC channel on irc.gnome.org to meet other GDP members
         and discuss any questions you may have.  For a list of GDP
         projects and members, see the

       <para>
        GNOME developers, packagers, and translators may not be
        writing GNOME documentation but will want to understand how
        the GNOME documentation system works and will need to
        collaborate with GDP members.  This document should help to
        outline the structure of how the GNOME documentation system
        works.  Developers who do not write the documentation for
        their applications are encouraged to find a GDP member to
        write the documentation.  This is best done by sending an
        email to the <ulink
        url="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gnome-doc-list/">
        <citetitle>gnome-doc-list mailing list</citetitle> </ulink>
        describing the application, where it can be downloaded from,
        and that the developer(s) would like a GDP member to write
        documentation for the application. The #docs IRC channel on
       Üirc.gnome.org is another option for contacting GDP members.

      <sect3 id="know">
        <title>Document Something You Know</title>
        <para>
          The most frequently asked question of new contributors who
          join the GDP is "which document should I start
          with?". Because most people involved are volunteers, we7do
          not <emphasis>assign</emphasis> projects and applications to
          write documents for. The first step is all yours - you must
          decide what about GNOME interests you most and find out if
          it has complete documents or not.
        </para>
        <para>
          It is also important to spend some time with GNOME to make
          sure you are familiar enough with it to be
          <emphasis>authoritative</emphasis>  in your writing. The
     developer.gnome.org/doc/FAQ/"
     best way to do this is to just sit down and play with GNOME
          as much as possible before starting to write.
        </para>
        <para>
          The easiest way to get started is to improve existing
          documentation. If you notice some inaccuracies or omissions
          in the documentation, or you think that you can explain the
          material more clearly, just send your suggestions to the
          author of the original documentation or to the GNOME
          documentation project at <email>docs@gnome.org</email>.

          web page which tracks the status of all the various
          documentation components of GNOME.  These components include
          application documentation, internal GNOME component
          documentation, user documentation, and developer
          documentation.  For each documentation item, it tracks the
          current status of the documentation, who is working on the
          particular document, where the documentation can be found,
          and provides a forum for the discussion of each item.

          yourself as an author so that other authors do not duplicate
          your work and may contact you to help or offer suggestions.
          Also be sure to keep the status icons up-to-date  so that
          the GDP team can easily identify which items need additional
          help.  The <citetitle>DocTable</citetitle> also allows

        All documentation for the GNOME project is written in SGML

        <title>GDP DTD (PNG Image Support)</title>
        <para>
          Due to some license issues involved with the creation of
          gifs, the GNOME Documentation Project has decided to use the
          PNG image format for all images in GNOME documentation. You

        <para>
          The current DocBook DTD(3.1) does not include support for
          embedding PNG images in your documents.  Since the GDP uses
          many screenshots in its documentation, we use our own
          variation on the DocBook DTD which has PNG image support.
          We encourage everybody to use this DTD instead of the
          default DocBook DTD since your source document header and
          your output document appearance subtly vary between the two
          DTD's.  To install the GDP custom DTD with PNG image support

          There are many editors on Linux and UNIX systems available
          to you. Which editor you use to work on the sgml documents
          is completely up to you, as long as the editor is able to
          preserve sgml and produce the source in a format that is
          readable by everyone.

          <application>Emacs</application> and
          <application>vi</application>. These and other editors are
          used regularly by members of the GDP. Emacs has a major
          mode, psgml, for editing sgml files which can save you time
          and effort in addin_ and closing tags. You will find the
          psgml package in DocBook Tools, which is the standard set of

        <title>Creating Something Useful with your Docs</title>
        <para>
          The tools available in DocBook Tools allow you to convert
          your sgml document to many different formats including html
          and Postscript. The primary tool used to do the conversion
          is an application called <application>Jade</application>. In
          most cases you will not have to work directly with
          <application>Jade</application>; Instead,  you will use the
          scripts provided by DocBook Tools.
        </para>
        <para>
          To preview your DocBook document, it is easiest to convert
          it to <filename>html</filename>. If you have ins{alled the
          DocBook tools described above, all you have to do is to run
          the command <prompt>$</prompt><command>db2html
          mydocument.sgml</command>. If there are no sgml syntax
          errors, this will create a directory <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> and place the
          resulting html files in it. The title page of the document
          will typically be
          <filename>mydocument/index.html</filename>.  If you have
          screenshots in your document, you will have to copy these
          files into the <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> directory by
          hand. You can use any web browser to view your doƒument.
          Note that every time you run <command>db2html</command>, it
          creates the <filename
          class="directory">mydocument</filename> directory over, so
          you will have to copy the screenshots over each time.
        </para>
        <para>
          You can also convert your document to PostScript by running
          the command <prompt>$</prompt><command>db2ps
          mydocument.sgml</command>, after which you can print out or
          view the resulting .ps file.

            The html files you get will not look quite the same as the
            documentation distributed with GNOME unless you have the
            custom stylesheets installed on your machine. DocBook
            Tools' default stylesheets will produce a different look
            to your docs. You can read more about the GDP stylesheets

          The DocBook Tools scripts and applications are smart enough
          to know that when you are creating html you will be using
          PNG files and when you are creating Postscript you will be
          using EPS files (you must use EPS with Postscript).
        </para>
        <para>
          Thus, you should never explicitly
          include the extension of the image file, since DocBook

          If you want to create PostScript ouput, you will need to create an

          easily. You can download this file - img2eps - from <ulink

          (look for the img2eps section).  Note that this script is
          included in the gnome-doc-tools package, so if you are using

          MicroGui theme and Helvetica 12pt font. (A different window
          manager can be used provided the MicroGui theme is available

        more bugs in the software.  These bugs vary from small ones,

        <interface>About</interface> dialogs in the menu, to large
        ones which cause the applet to crash.  As all users, you
        should be sure to report these bugs so that application

      <title>Using CVS</title>
      <para>
        CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool that allows
        multiple developers to concurrently work on a set of
        documents, keeping track of the modifications made by each
        person.  The files are stored on a server and each developer
        checks files out, modifies them, and then checks in their
        modified versioŽ of the files.  Many GNOME programs and
        documents are stored in CVS.  The GNOME CVS server allows
        users to anonymously check out CVS files. Most GDP members
        will need to use anonymous CVS to download the most up-to-date
        version of documentation or programs.  Modified documents will
        typically be emailed to the the application developer. Core
        GDP members may also be granted login CVS privileges so they
        may commit modified files directcvs -z3 update -Pd</command>.
        </para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="logincv_">
        <title>Login CVS</title>  <para>  If you have been given a
        login for the GNOME CVS server,  you may commit your file
        modifications to CVS.  Be sure to read the following section
        on CVS etiquette before making any commits to CVS.  To log in
        to the CVS server as user
        <command><replaceable>username</replaceable></command> with a
        password, you must first set your CVSROOT shell variable with
        <command> export
        CVSROOT=':pserver:<repl   ble>username</replaceable>@cvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome'</command>.
        Log in with <command>cvs login</command> and enter your
        password. You may check out and update modules as described
        above for anonymous CVS access.  As a login CVS user, you may
        also check modified versions of a file into the CVS server.
        To cdified by
          multiple developers and documentation authors, users should
          exercise a few simple practices out of courtesy towards the
          other CVS users and the project leader.  First, you should
          not make CVS commits to a package without first discussing
          your plans with the project leader.  This way, the project
          leader knows who is modifying the files and generally, what
          sort of changes/development is being done.  Also, whenever a
          CVS user commits a file to CVS, they should make an entry in
          the CVS log and in the <filename>ChangeLog</filename> so
          that other users know who is making modifications and what
          is being modified.  When modifying files created by others,

        At the core of the GNOME help system is the <application>GNOME
        Help Browser</application>. The <application>Help
        Browser</application> provides a unified interface to several
        distinct documentation systems on Linux/Unix systems: man
        pages, texinfo pages, Linux Documentation Project(LDP)
        documents, GNOME application documentation, and other GNOME
        documents.
      </para>
      <para>
        The <application>GNOME Help Browser</application> works by
        searching standard directories for documents which are to be
        presented.  Thus, the documentation that appears in the GHB is
        specific to each computer and will typically only represent
        software that is installed on the computer.

      Nautilus will be the file manager/graphical shell for GNOME 2.0

      used in GNOME 1.0.  It will read and display DocBook files
      directly, avoiding the need for duplicating documents in both
"     DocBook and HTML formats.  Its display engine for DocBook will
      be much faster than running <application>jade</application> to
      convert to HTML for rendering.  Because it uses the original
      DocBook source for documentation, it will be possible to do more
      sophisticated searching using the meta information included in

<!-- ####### DocBook Basics | Introduction to DocBook ####### -->

    <sect2 id="introtodocbook">
      <title>Introduction to DocBook</title>
      <para>
        To understand DocBook, a basic understanding of SGML is
        helpful. SGML stands for Standard General Markup Language and
        is one of the first markup languages every created. HTML is
        actually derived from SGML and XML is a subset of SGML.  SGML
        uses what is called a Document Type Definition to specify
        <emphasis>elements</emphasis> which are contained between
        brackets, &lt; and >. Text is marked by both beginning and
        ending elements, for example in the DocBook DTD, one denotes a
        title with <sgmltag>&lt;title></sgmltag>The
        Title<sgmltag>&lt;/title></sgmltag>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The DTD (in the case of the GDP, DocBook) defines rules for how the
        elements can be used. For example, if one element can only be used when
        embedded within another, this is defined in the DTD.
      </para>
      <para> 
	An SGML file is just a plain ASCII file containing the text
	with the markup specified above. To convert it  to some easily
	readable format, you need special tools. The GDP uses <emphasis>DocBook
        Tools</emphasis>, a free package of utilities for working with DocBook
        which includes <emphasis>Jade</emphasis>, which does the SGML/DSSL
        parsing. You can read more about DocBook Tools in <xref
        linkend="installingdocbook" />. 
      </para>
      <para>
        The final appearance of the output (e.g. PostScript or HTML)
        is determined by a
        <emphasis>stylesheet</emphasis>. Stylesheets are files,
        written in a special language (DSSSL &mdash; Document Style
        Semantics and Specification Language), which  specify the
        appearance of various DocBook elements, for example,
        what fonts to use for titles and various inline elements, page
        numbering style, and much more. DocBook tools aome with a
        collection of stylesheets (Norman Walsh's modular
        stylesheets); GNOME Document Project uses some customized
        version of this stylesheets &mdash+ see <xref
        linkend="gdpstylesheets"/>.   
      </para>
      <para>
        The advantage of specifying the <emphasis>structure</emphasis>
        of a document with SGML instead of specifying the
        <emphasis>appearance</emphasis> of the document with a typical
        word processor, or with html, is that the resulting document
        can be processed in a variety of ways using the structural¤        information.  Whereas formatting a document for appearance
        assumes a medium (typically written text on a standard-sized
        piece of paper), SGML can be processed to produce output for a
        large variety of mediw such as text, postscript, HTML,
        Braille, audio, and potentially many other formats.
      </para>
      <para>
        Using 'content' as the elements to define the text of a document also
       allows for search engines to make use of the actual elements to make a
        "smarter search". For example, if you are searching for all documents
        written by the author "Susie" your search engine couldNOME a be made smart
        enough to only search &lt;author> elements, making for a faster and more
        accurate search.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since the overall appearance of the output is determined not by the DTD
        or the SGML document, but rather by a stylesheet, the appearance of a
        doc]ment can be easily changed just by changing the stylesheet. This
        allows everyone in the project to create documents that all look the
        same.
      </para>
      <para>
        As stated before, the GDP uses the DocBook DTD.  For a list of
        introductory and reference resources on DocBook, see <xref
        linkend="resources" />.  The following sections also provide
        convenient instructions on which markup tags to use in various
        circumstances.  Be sure to read <xref linkend="conventions" />
        for GDP documentation-specific guidelines.

      <title>XML and SGML</title>

      <para> In not so distant future (probably before GNOME 2.0),
      DocBook itself and GNOME Documentation project will migrate from
      SGML to XML. This transition should be relatively painless:
      (almost) all DocBook tags will remain the same. However, XML has
      stricter syntax rules than SGML; thus, some constructions which
      are valid in SGML will not be valid in XML. Therefore, to be
      ready for this transistion, it is <emphasis>strongly
      advised</emphasis> that the documentation writers conform to XML
      syntax rules. Here are most important differences:

	    <term> <emphasis>Minimization</emphasis></term> 
	    <listitem>

	      It is possible with some implementations of SGML to use
	      minimizations to close elements in a document by using
	      &lt;/>, for example:
	      <literal><sgmltag>&lt;title></sgmltag>The
		Title<sgmltag>&lt;/></sgmltag></literal>. This is not
              allowed in XML. You can use <command>sgmlnorm</command> command,

         <para>
            Also, in SGML some tags are allowed not to have closing
            tags.  For example, it is legal for
            <sgmltag>&lt;xref></sgmltag> not to have a closing tag: 
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref 
                   linkend="someid"></sgmltag></literal>. In
            XML, it is illegal; instead, you should use  
            <literal><sgmltag>&lt;xref 
                   linkend="someid"/></sgmltag></literal> (note the

    </tUsing 'content' as the elements to define the text of a document also
       allows for search engines to make use of the actual elements to make a
        "smarter search". For example, if you are searching for all documents
        written by the author "Susie" your search engine couldNOME a be made smart
        enough to only search &lt;author> elements, making for a faster and more
        accurate search.

        Since the overall appearance of the output is determined not by the DTD
        or the SGML document, but rather by a stylesheet, the appearance of a
        doc]ment can be easily changed just by changing the stylesheet. This
        allows everyone in the project to create documents that all look the
        same.

        As stated before, the GDP uses the DocBook DTD.  For a list of
        introductory and reference resources on DocBook, see <xref
        linkend="resources" />.  The following sections also provide
        convenient instructions on which markup tags to use in various
        circumstances.  Be sure to read <xref linkend="conventions" />
        for GDP documentation-specific guidelines.
