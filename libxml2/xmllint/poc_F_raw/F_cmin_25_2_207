<abstract>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of
SGML that is completely described in this document. Its goal is to
enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web
in the way that is now possible with HTההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההההTML.</p>

<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
other interested parties and has been endorsed by the
Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
document and may be used as reference material or cited
as a normative reference from another document. W3C's
role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention
to the specification and t promote its widespread
deployment. This enhances the functionality and
interoperability of the Web.</p>
<p>
This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing,
widely used international text processing standard (Standard
Generalizad Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and
corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.  It is a product of the W3C
XML Activity, details of which can be found at <loc
href='http://www.w3.org/XML'>http://www.w3.org/XML</loc>.  A list of
current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found
at <loc href='http://www.w3.org/TR'>http://www.w3.org/TR</loc>.
</p>
<p>This specification uses the term URI, which is defined by <bibref
ref="Berners-Lee"/>, a work in progress expected to update <bibref
ref="RFC1738"/> and <bibref ref="RFC1808"/>.

comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
change expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan Connolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter soinformative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
mo{e some referencesfrom Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),
add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee et al.),
move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fragment identifiers are
NOT part of the URI formally speaking, and are NOT legal in 
system identifiers (processor 'may' signal an error).
Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,
