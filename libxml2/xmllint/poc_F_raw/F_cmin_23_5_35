  VERSION INFORMATION
	2009-02-25 
	* Update DSDL namespace to use schematron.com
	* Tested with SAX7N9, Xalan 2.7.1, IE7, 
	* IE does not like multiple variables in same template with same name: rename.   
	2008-09-18
	* Remove new behaviour for include, because it conflicts with existing usage [KH]
	* Add extends[@href] element with that merge functionality
	* Generate PIs to notate source of inclusions for potential better diagnostics
	
	2008-09-16
	* Fix for XSLT1
	
	2008-08-28
	* New behaviour for schematron includes: if the pointed to element is the same as the current,
	include the children.
	
	2008-08-20
	* Fix bug: in XSLT1 cannot do $document/id('x') but need to use for-each
	
e include-relaxng & include-crdl (KH, PH)
	* Allow inclusion oP XSLT and XHTML (KH)
	* Fix inclusion of fragments (KH)
	
	2008-07-25
