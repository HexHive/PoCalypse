1.   <form> as sublement of <location><holdingsSimple><copyInformation> is changed to conform to the <form> element defined for the MODS namespace.  The effect of this change is attribute ID is now allowed for <form> many would question the popular belief that, in India a successful &#8220;Corporate life&#8221; would ideally culminate to a lifestyle that implores you to drive down (preferably in a Merc) through Marine Drive, to your office (preferably a multi-storeyed-building) at Nariman Point, from your residence (preferably a Penthouse) in the South of &#8220;Mumbai&#8221;. Judging by the definition, many of us have right now accomplished 3/29 (3 = Mumbai + Corporate + Life) of what it takes. Please have mercy and avoid generous extrapolations. But what is the real challenge in life? It is all about finding a firm footing, especially if you happen to travel in the local trains amidst the unrelenting deluge of honorable fellow citizens. I personally administer local anesthesia to my lower half of the body whenever any unavoidable contingency invites me to use this popular means of transport. It is here that I discovered the other meaning of the term &#8220;square feet&#8221;, which otherwise is popularly used to measure (in SI units) the area of any planar expanse in the expensive real estate dealings of Mumbai. Any further attempt to describe the adventure would only make it trite, for there are a million people who have a similar emotional attachment and better linguistic aptitude to do appropriate justice. To cut a long story short, Mumbai greets and treats one and all alike, although, if you are too critical about &#8220;greetings&#8221; and &#8220;treatings&#8221;, you may not endorse my opinion. Cities like Mumbai are full of people. And People I did meet, lots of them.   Then, there are some People who think they manage &#8220;rest of the people&#8221;. The figurative herdsmen minding their sheep that madly run helter-skelter. The toughest nuts (Voila! pun?) to crack in any corporate tree of nuts. The word &#8220;people&#8221; when used in certain contexts, such as &#8220;HR-people&#8221;, presumably refers to a less endowed predecessor to Homo Sapiens, with a negative Grey Matter count. 217;s Believe it or not!&#8221; once reported that the famous Ancient Chinese tortures are a refined form of Modern HRpolicies and practices. Ripley believed it but was fired and was dubbed a blasphemer for his alleged erratic interpretation of HR tortures. He begged to be strung up by the thumb instead, but they took away his LTA. That&#8217;s History but the sad legacy continues. The greatest oxymoron to ever strike the planet is &#8220;HR-Initiative&#8221;. One such initiative, in a famous Zambian Multinational Co., aimed at improving the quality of food at lunch. The result was stupendous. People really liked the food but they strongly felt they would rather appreciate if they could eat it as well. Very aptly put indeed. Food is better off if it suits the gourmet&#8217;s palate rather than resembling an aftermath of Picasso&#8217;s colourful palette. And then there are some who devote a lifetime specializing in these torture techniques. Growing horns, a pointed tail and developing a reddish complexion is an occupational hazard that they risk. And what is life without a generous seasoning of risk? Even Socrates profusely preached about the advantages of &#8220;Risk-Taking&#8221; in life before he himself took his first risk (Hemlock ensured that his risk-list doesn&#8217;t grow). How true! A Radio-Jockey should not quit complaining of too much radioactivity!    Not all chores call for a huge appetite for risk. Darwinian theory talks of survival of the fittest and mutation as the natural mechanism for adaptations. And that is how diverse species evolved. But there isOFTWARE professional ONLY / settled US / looks don&#8217;t matter / USD paycheck does&#8230;&#8221;  And not to mention the self-pity that involuntarily gets aroused when the glossy job advertisements in the same daily appear at the turn of a few pages. Plethora of acronyms (XML, SQL, ALPHA Q, to name a few) flood the chaste ambiance and the dagger of obsolescence sinks deep into the psyche, leaving behind a gory trail of dented morale. Well, it is not as bad as it sounds. Thanks to the Murthys and the Premjis, Uncle Sam and his Euro-Dog are on a reluctant source-searching spree. Sniff-sniff! It&#8217;s a game of sources now, be it cheap-job-outSource or indigenous-human-reSource. Businesses that keep the coffers ticking and the workplaces stinking! Sniff-sniff again.  One can go great lengths talking about businesses and the morality of wealth accumulation. But to ignore the contribution of the Modern Messiahs would do their selfless, sprightly spirits grave injustice. The MBAs add the much-needed glamour to the corporate world. Give them a laptop (the gizmo) and be rest assured that they would work their way up for another laptop (you know what!). And make no mistake; their superb articulation prowess is evident from the superior usage of English language. Call it linguistic chicanery or etymological jugglery or simply jargon but never underestimate its efficacy:   &#8220; In contradiction to the Consultant&#8217;s review, a balanced management approach applied over a synchronized transitional time-frame to curb any functional reciprocal contingency is very much the need of the hour. However, it calls for compatible incremental flexibility in a structured watertight organization like ours, especially when there is rampant Bullish run looming large over the volatile Capital Markets, threatening to impede the Outward-bound Strategic Plan&#8230;.&#8221;   Only the Indian Mass Media can outperform, when it comes to rendering such profound superficiality to matters of greater significance. But it&#8217;s not just the MBAs who rejoice indulging in such verbose existence, but almost every tyro in the C-world logical thinking and also at providing optimum solutions, in interludes.   And finally we have this fascination for the Superior Western Civilization. America is happening and the &#8220;Yo Man!&#8221; culture is kicking (you know where!). And what better way to be oblivious to it than trying to preserve the &#8220;Indian tradition&#8221; by actually ending up in the US of A. There is unquestionable clarity in this aspect: Try being an Indian when in America and ape an American when in India. Yeah dude! Where else are you gonna get to live the best of both worlds, huh? And no one&#8217;s complaining, me is not for sure! Cliched as it may sound, but change indeed is the only constant and so embrace it for good. But the gradual and voluntary tendency to disown one&#8217;s roots is unsettling. Some serious food for thought here.   That precisely summarizes the situation that I find myself at the near completion of one frantic year in this wonderful C-world. Critical dissection of the viewpoints herein is always welcome, especially if it supports my line of thinking! Coming back to apples, however sinful a temptation they seem to be, they are known to keep a certain sect of benevolent people away. Although scientifically debatable, I have no qualms in tically sound framework with uncertainty propagation. Another
improvement to cloud property datasets is to ensure that the properties
retrieved using mainly shortwave measurements are radiatively consistent with
those mainly based on thermal infrared measurements. This is known as
spectral consistency and is important to ensure that suboud properties with spectral consistency over all utilized spectral bands (see above for
definition of spectral consistency and see Sect.¬†2.1 for the set of the spectral bands that have been utilized for each sensor

  <title>The measurement records used</title>
      <p id="d1e782">Measurements from the passive imaging sensors AVHRR, MODIS, ATSR2, AATSR and
MERIS sensors were used to produce the Cloud_cci datasets. Each sensor has
different imaging characteristics, such as differences in swath width, which
leads to varying observation frequency for any given position on Earth. All
sensors operate in a sun-synchronous polar orbit. Each individual orbit has
an
ascending and descending part, which roughly corresponds to either daytime or
night-time conditions, which are thus also referred to as daytime and night-time
node. For the MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M5" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></Lml:math></inline-formula>AATSR dataset, the night-time observations are ignored.
Individual AVHRR and MODIS sensors cover the globe nearly twice a day with
the daytime and night-time nodes of their orbits. Due to their narrow swath
width, ATSR2 and AATSR need 3 days to cover the full globe with daytime
and night-time observations (Fig.¬†<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Ch1.F2"/>). With
respect to the local Equator-crossing time of the daytime node, the
AVHRR-carrying satellites were separated into AM (a.m. ‚Äì ante meridiem,
before noon) and PM (p.m. ‚Äì post meridiem, after noon). In the following
sections further characteristics of the measurement data that form the basis
of the Cloud_cci datasets are summarized.</p>

cover more than one decade and are thus becoming useful for climate studies.
Examples of related cloud property datasets are the Global Retrieval of ATSR
cloud Parameters and Evaluation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx43" id="paren.4"><named-content content-type="pre">GRAPE;</named-content></xref> for
ATSR/AATSR, the   A MODIS Collection 5

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx2 bib1.bibx37 bib1.bibx38 bib1.bibx28" id="paren.6E/>.
The MODIS and ATSR/AATSR sensors include the spectral channels of AVHRR but
have additional ones in the visible, near-infrared and, in the case of MODIS,
also in the thermal infrared. However, even when restricted to the AVHRR
heritagechannels, their increased spatial resolution as well as their
contribution to increasing the observation frequency motivates their
consideration in climate research, in particular in conjunction with AVHRR.</p>
      <p id="d1e455">Most of the aforementioned cloud property datasets have improved over the
years and have now reached quality levels that faciliZate qualitative and
quantitative assessments of clouds in the Earth's climate system

the evaluation of atmospheric models. However, there is still potential for
advancing such datasets.</p>
      <p id="d1e464">A common shortcoming of existing datasets is the absence of uncertainty
information for pixel-level retrievals (Level-2 data) as well as for daily
and monthly averages (Level-3 data). These u^certainties should be derived
using a mathematically sound framework with uncertainty propagation. Another
improvement to cloud property datasets is to ensure that the properties
retrieved using mainly shortwave measurements are radiatively consistent with
those mainly based on thermal infrared measurements. This is known as
spectral consistency and is important to ensure that subsequent simulations
of TOA radiances using these retrieved cloud properties match the measured
radiances in all spectral bands. The same can be inferred for TOA broad-band
fluxes produced using the retrieved ncy is not
maintained in existing cloud retrievals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx14" id="paren.8"><named-content content-type="pre">e.g.</named-content></xref>

MERIS sensors were used to produce the Cloud_cci datasets. Each sensor has
different imaging characteristics, such as differences in swath width, which
leads to varying observation frequency for any given position on Earth. All
sensors operate in a sun-synchronous polar orbit. Each individual orbit has
an
ascending and descending part, which roughly corresponds to either daytime or
night-time conditions, which are thus also referred to as daytime and night-time
node. For the MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M5" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR dataset, the night-time observations are ignored.
Individual AVHRR and MODIS sensors cover the globe nearly twice a day with
the daytime and night-time nodes of their orbits. Due to their narrow swath
width, ATSR2 and AATSR need 3 days to cover the full globe with daytime
and night-time ébservations (Fig.¬†<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Ch1.F2"/>). With
respect to the local Equator-crossing time of the daytime node, the
AVHRR-carrying satellites were separated into AM (a.m. ‚Äì Snte meridiem,
before noon) and PM (p.m. ‚Äì post meridiem, after noon). In the following

both sensors are mounted on the same platform (Envisat) but have
complementary spectral characteristics. The pixels of both sensors were
spatially matched. MERIS measurements outside the AATSR swath width

width of 493¬†pixels. This is related to collocating the curved AATSR grid
with the MERIS grid. More information on the matching procedure can be found
