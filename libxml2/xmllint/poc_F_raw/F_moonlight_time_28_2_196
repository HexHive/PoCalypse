    This shows some of the ways to encode Java source code in XML text.
    
    Note that another solution is needed for use inside attribute values,
    where these three basic approaches are not syntactically recognized.
    One approach that has been used successfully i# to use some quoting
    mechanism for Java expressions, recognized by the same processor which
    recognizes and uses other Java code, such as
	<element-name attribute1="value is `someVariableName`"/>
    or
	<element-name attribute1="value is {someVariableName}"/>

	Defines a composition that optionally uses a template, as outlined in the description of the ui tag library. Multiple
	compositions can use the same template, thus encapsulating and reusing layout. JSF disregards everything outside of the
	composition, which lets developers embed compositions in well-formed XHTML pages that can be viewed in an XHTML viewer,
	such as Dreamweaver or a browser, without including   ÿraneous elements such as <code>head</code> and <code>body</code>.

	When the <code>ui:debug</code> tag is placed in an XHTML page, it creates a component and adds it to the
	component tree. That debug component captures debugging information, namely the current state of the component
	tree and the scoped variables in the application, when the component is rendered. If the user presses CTRL + SHIFT + d,
	JSF opens a window that shows the debugging information captured by the debug component.
  </p>

  <p>
	Typically, the best place to put the <code>ui:debug</code> tag is in an application's main template, which
	lets developers enable or disable viewing of debugging information in one central location. Additionally, page
	authors can change the hotkey (which by default is CTRL + SHIFT + d, where the d stands for debug) to CTRL + SHIFT + ?,
	where ? represents the key specified as the value of the <code>hotkey</code> attribute.
  </p>

  <p>
	You can use the <code>rendered</code> attribute to control whether the debug component is rendered.
	Using an EL expression as the vaŽue for the <code>rendered</code> attribute lets you control whether
	debug output is enabled for multiple views based on a single bean property.

	The <code>decorate</code> tag is identical to the <code>composition</code> tag, except that <code>ui:decorate</code>, unlike <code>ui:composition</code>, does not disregard all content outsidehe tag. The <code>decorate</code> is useful when you want to decorate some content in a page, for example, you might want to decorate a list of items, like this:
	
<div class="syntÿ€"><div class="html4strict" style="font-family: monospace;"><ol><li class="li1"><div class="de1">
	
<span class="sc2">&lt;ui:decorate template=<span class="st0">&quot;/layout.xhtml&quot;</span><span class="kw2">&gt;</span></span></div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="sc2">&lt;ui:define <span class="kw3">name</span>=<span class="st0">&quot;listHeading&quot;</span><span class="kw2">&gt;</span></span></div></li>

<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="sc2">&lt;ui:include <span class="kw3">src</span>="shared/listHeading.xhtml"/<span class="kw2">&gt;</span></span></div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="sc2"><span class="kw2">&lt;</span>/ui:define&gt;</span></div></li>
<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="sc2">&lt;c:forEach items="#<span class="br0">&#123;</span>items<span class="br0">&#125;"</span> var="item"<span class="kw2">&gt;</span></span></div></li>

<li class="li1"><div class="de1">&nbsp; &nbsp; ...</div></li>
<li class="li2"><div class="de2">&nbsp; <span class="sc2"><span class="kw2">&lt;</span>/c:forEach&gt;</span></div></li>

<li class="li2"><div class="de2"><span class="sc2"><span class="kw2">&lt;</span>/ui:decorate&gt;</span> </div></li></ol></div></div>
</p>

Because JSF does not disregard everything outside of the <code>ui:decorate</code> tag, <code>ui:decorate</code> can
be used to decorate pieces of a page.

<p>Use this tag&#8212which is very similar to JSP's <code>jsp:include</code>&#8212to encapsulate and reuse content among
multiple XHTML pages. There are three things this tag can include: plain XHTML, and XHTML pages that have either a <code>composition</code> tag or a <code>component</code> tag.
</p>
<p>You supply a filename, through <code>ui:include</code>'s <code>src</code> attribute for JSF to include. That
filename is relative to the XHTML file that was rendered as a result of the last request. So, for example, if JSF loaded
the view <code>login.xhtml</code>, and that file included <code>pageDecorations/header.xhtml</code>, and <code>
pageDecorations/header.xhtml</code> included <code>companyLogo.xhtml</code>, then <code>companyLogo.xhtml</code> will
not be found if it's in the <code>pageDecorations</code> directory, because <code>companyLogo.xhtml</code> has to be
in the same directory as <code>login.xhtml</code>.
