It is this 'little constitution' we are under the spell of, have coined as the "Evolutionary Impulse" or also the "Evolutionary Drive"--the inexplicable compulsive desire to wear leser species as coats and shoes, eat beef, mate, castegate others who choose to engage in the naughty behavior harking back to the days of yore, the days of urea, of random bedfellows, of noncommittal interactions, of skinnydipping in the primordial hot tub...   So.... If I had to select one thing to bear the title of the ultimate menace, the fiendish "They" -- the winner would be Evolution and its goddam impuls. And to Evolution and company, to them, ALL the "they"s, I say this and this alone:   "Fuck-off... Please" *  * My southern-bred goodnature, or rather, the lingering vestiges of its passive/ polite feminimity that a year of aggressive  manhattan-education hasn't been able to erase---where was I--oh yes, my southern-bred goodnature forces me to be courteous and slightly recoil when asserting myself and/or swearing, thus I must always at the "please" when rebuffing others.

       Once upon a Seico, when Swatches outsold Swiss, And actors read their lines from Pennsylvania Avenue, Farrah Bighare, a "working girl,"  whilst straddling the sran-wrap ceiling (among other things)â€” gazed from her compact-corner cubicle at the architecturely-ambitious window, a 7-foot naval centered in the Aquamarine wall. Her swollen eyes swallowed the glass bricksâ€” glistening like hot fatâ€” whn the great-Budha belly of the 7th floor.

And so Farrahâ€”perhaps cued by the innate, maternal drive that survived a decade of bra-burningâ€” set out and set forth (Aqua-net and all) for the local Sperm Banc. She picked and chose, they cut and pasted a gene or two, Hence, through the miracle of Eugenics, Eight months and a fortnight later, a test-tube toddler exploded from her plastic Petrie-Dish womb.

       Oncir lines from Pennsylvania Avenue, Farrah Bighare, a "working d rl,"  whilst straddling the sran-wrap ceiling (among other things)â€” gazed from her compact-corner cubicle at the architecturel“-ambitious window, a 7-foot naval centered in the Aquamarine wall. Her swollen eyes swallowed the glass bricksâ€” glistening like hot fatâ€” which took on the appearance of some semi-precious jewel, lodged in the great-Budha belly of the 7th floor.

Copper dust descends upon the legally-bound three,  the ith thiir chills steal-stream-lined rusted promises, abandoned in the great  Dakota hospice-- made to fly those aerodynamic-reflective toaster-jets with wheels, And weren't  we supposed to be their rocketteers? Nothing ever got off the ground, But rather, simply settled in to the hypnotic inertia  of white lines on black-tarred stretches of assphault,  of pointed tarps, popcorn, crusted-cotton candy, cold  corn dogs, mad laughter, shrill cries, rickety roller-coasters, polk-a-dotsey" is a pastiche of people, plazzers, roars, fire-- And damnit what happened to my spotlight?

And so ywasn't Vegas; Kids just kick the clowns,  the freak shows aren't PC enough for Patchican, Missouri......  And that's why Hormona hated Oily Ivory. A new generation, a new attraction, a final prayer for Hubert  and the Big-Top Circus. The old-sparsely-spikenever-has-been, now insecure,  would soon be obsolete. She leads the child to her cubicle above the fold-out dining area, then  ddles away with--he spake-- 	Child, Willy Wonka awaits you in the woods, d your happiness in taffy and cream, Vow never to retuurn to this cursed-tent, no matter how 'gingerbread-and-apple-cide'r your mothe-queen  	may make it seem. And with that, the great-
