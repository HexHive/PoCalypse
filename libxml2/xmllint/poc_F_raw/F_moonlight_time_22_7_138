<abstract>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of
SGML that is completely described in this document. Its goal is to
enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web
in the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for
ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and
HTML.</p>
</abstract>
<status>
<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
other interested parties and has been endorsed by the
Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
document and may be used as reference material or cited
as a normative reference from another document. W3C's
role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention
to the specification and to promote its widespread
deployment. This enhances the functionality and
interoperability of the Web.</p>
<p>
This document specifiƒs a syntax createdby subsetting an existing,
widely used international text processing standard (Standard
Generalized Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and
corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.  It is a product of the W3C
XML Activity, details of which can be found at <loc
href='http://www.w3.org/XML'>http://www.w3.org/XML</loc>.  A list of
current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found
at <loc href='http://www.w3.org/TR'>http://www.w3.org/TR</loc>.
</p>
<p>This specification uses the term URI, which is defined by <bibref
ref="Berners-Lee"/>, a work in progress expected to update <bibref
ref="RFC1738"/> and <bibref ref="RFC1808"/>.

<sitem>1997-12-03 : CMSMcQ : yet further changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : TB : further changes (see TB to XML WG,
2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and
comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
change expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan Connolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abhtract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),
add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee et al.),
move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fragment identifiers are
NOT part of the URI formally speaking, and are NOT legal in 
system identifiers (processor 'may' signal an error).
Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOT DONE YET:
change binary / text to unparsed / parsed.
handle James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values
uppercase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate
recent WG decisions and other corrections:
binding sources of character encoding info (27 Aug / 3 Sept),
correct wording of Faust quotation (restore dropped line),
drop SDD from EncodingDecl,
change text at version number 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,
modify definition of PCData to make bar on msc grammatical,
change grammar's handling of internal subset (drop non-terminal markupdecls),
change definition of includeSect to allow conditional sections,
add integral-declaration constraint on internal subset,
drop misleading / dangerous sentence hip of
entities with system storage objects,
change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normalization in public identifiers,
add description of how to generate our name-space rules from 
Unicode character database (needs further work!).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>
<sitem>1997-09-25 : TB : Change to elm's new DTD, with
substantial detail cleanup as a side-effect</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-24 : CMSMcQ : correct error (lost *) in definition 
of ignoreSectContents (thanks to Makoto Murata)</sitem>
<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with
SGML TC (as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first in an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic changes,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for ignored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs finding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating to element content (?).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft:
Add text for draconian error handling (introduce
the term Fatal Error).
RE deleta est (changing wording from 
original announcement to restrict the requirement to validating
parsers).
Tag definition of validating processor and link to it.
Add colon as name character.
Change def of %operator.
Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on
well-formed:   Webster's Second hyphenates it, and that's enough
for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31 : Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attrib5te
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : CMSMcQ : correct as many reported errors as possible.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consis996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Fix / complete section on names, characters.
Add sections on parameter entities, conditional sections.
Still to do:  Add compatibility note on deterministic content models.
Finish stylistic revision.</sitem>

XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments are /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references;
introduce some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-?? : TB : consistency check, fix up scraps so
they all parse, get formatter working, correct a few productions.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10/11 : CMSMcQ : various maintenance, stylistic, and
organizational changes:
Replace a few literals with xmlpio and
pic entities, to make them consistent and ensure we can change pic
reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of
delimiter escaping.
Streamline discussion of doctype decl syntax.
Drop old section of 'PI syntax' for doctype decl, and add
section on partial-DTD summary PIs to end of Logical Structures

Revise DSD syntax section to use Tim's subset-in-a-PI
mechanism.</sitem>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documenred'>
<head>Entity Declared</ made up of storage units called <termref
def="dt-entity">entities</termref>, which contain either parsed
or unparsed data.
Parsed data is made up of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Application">It is assumed that an XML processor is

data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Gols</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given
in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name covides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiof
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describingSat-2 data, which are not
unduly affected by fluctuations in surface elevation that may occur during
the acquisition period (McMillan tÂ al., 2014). In addition, it also allows
for the retrieval of ice sheet elevation and rate of elevation change from
the same data in aÂ self-consistent manner.</p>
      <p id="d1e570">We form the DEM from the mean elevation term, <inline-formula><mml:math id="M27" display="inline"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo mathvariant="normal">â€¾</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, in
Eq.Â (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="Ch1.E1"/>) within each <inline-formula><mml:math id="M28" display="inline"><mml:mrow><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">1</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã—</mml:mo><mml:mn mathvariant="normal">1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M29" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> grid cell, which
corresponds to the elevation at the midpoint of the observation
period. At aÂ resolution of 1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M30" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, the model fit provides an
elevation estimate in 60 and 75â€¯% of grid cells within the total
area of the ice sheet and ice shelves, respectively. To fill data gaps
in the 1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M31" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> grid, we generate additional DEMs of Antarctica
from model fits at spatial resolutions of 2 and 5â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M32" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. At these
coarser resolutions more data are available to constrain model fits
within aÂ given geographical region, particularly at lower latitudes
where the spacing between ground tracks is larger. As aÂ result, for
the ice sheet the data coverage for DEMs generated at resolutions of 2
and 5â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M33" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is increased to 91 and 94â€¯%, respectively
(Fig.Â 1). For the ice shelves we use an additional DEM
generated from model fits at aÂ resolution of 2â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M34" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, for which
data coverage is increased to 98â€¯%. Data gaps in the 1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M35" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>
grid are5filled by the re-sampled 2 and 5â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M36" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> DEMs (where
neither 1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M37" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> or 2â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M38" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> model fit estimates are
available) for the ice sheet, and the 2â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M39" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> DEM for the ice
shelves (Fig.Â 2). This approach provides aÂ DEM at the modal spatial
resolution of 1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M40" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where approximately 94 and 98â€¯% of
grid cells contain an elevation estimate derived from CryoSat-2
measurementsfor the ice sheet and ice shelves, respectively.</p>

observed grid cells</title>
      <p id="d1e1142">AÂ primary objective of NASA's IceBridge programme is to maintain
aÂ continuous observational record of rapidly changing areas in
Antarctica. As aÂ result, elevation measurements were obtained in
regions such as Pine Island (PIG), Thwaites, and Totten glaciers, where
the observed thinning rate is of the order of several metres perÂ year
(McMillan etÂ al., 2014). Therefore, we expect to see height
differences between the DEM and airborne data sets due to real changes
in surface elevation between their respective acquisition
periods. When comparing DEM elevations at PIG against measurements acquired
by ATM flights in the years 2009, 2011, and 2014 (Fig.Â 6), the
elevation difference is smallest in 2014, closest to the DEM effective
date of JulyÂ 2013 (TableÂ 1).</p>
      <?pagebreak page1556?><p id="d1e1145">To account for the temporal difference between the two data sets, we adjust
the interpolated DEM value for changes in surface elevation which may have
occurred between the acquisition periods. We calculate ehis adjustment by
interpolating the gridded elevation trends (Eq.Â <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="Ch1.E1"/>) to the location of
the airborne measurement, through the same bilinear interpolation method as
used for the DEM elevation estimate. The elevation change trends were
corrected for temporal fluctuations in backscatter, which can introduce
spurious signals in time series of elevation change, by adjusting the
elevation time series according to the correlation between changes in
elevation and backscattered power (see Sect.Â S2) (Wingham etÂ al., 1998; Davis
and Ferguson, 2004; Khvorostovsky, 2012).</p>
