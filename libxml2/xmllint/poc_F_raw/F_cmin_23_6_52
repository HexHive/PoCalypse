    <p id="d1e348">New cloud property datasets based on measurements from the passive
imaging satellite sensors AVHRR, MODIS, ATSR2, AATSR and MERIS are presented.
Two retrieval systems were developed that include components for cloud
detection and cloud typing followed by cloud property retrievals based on the
optimal estimation (OE) technique. The OE-based retrievals are applied to
simultaneously retrieve cloud-top pressure, cloud particle effective radius
and cloud optical thickness using measurements at visible, near-infrared and
thermal infrared wavelengths, which ensures spectral consistency. The
retrieved cloud properties are further processed to derive cloud-top height,
cloud-top temperature, cloud liquid water path, cloud ice water path and
spectral cloud albedo. The Cloud_cci products are pixel-based retrievals,
daily composites of those on a global equal-angle latitudeâ€“longitude grid,
and monthly cloud properties such as averages, standard deviations and
histograms, also on a global grid. All products include rigorous propagation
of the retrieval and sampling uncertainties. Grouping the orbital properties
of the sensor families, six datasets have been defined, which are named
AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, ATSR2-AATSR and MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR,
each comprising a specific subset of all available sensors. The individual
characteristics of the datasets are presented together with a summary of the
retrieval systems and measurement records on which the dataset generation
were based. Example validation results are given, based on comparisons to
well-established reference observations, which demonstrate the good quality
of the data. In particular the ensured spectral consistency and the rigorous
uncertainty propagation through all processing levels can be considered as
new features of the Cloud_cci datasets compared to existing datasets. In
addition, the consistency among the individual datasets allows for a
potential combination of them as well as facilitates studies on the impact of
temporal sampling and spatial resolution on cloud climatologies.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
      <p id="d1e406">Satellite-based datasets of geophysical variables are crucial fo” climate
research as they represent observations of the Earth's climate system, which
can be used for both the analysis of the climate and its variability as well
as guidance for atmospheric model developments. These datasets evolve
periodically by mainly two activities: (1)Â extending and improving the
underlying radiance record by adding new satellite recordings and applying
new inter-calibration to the entire record, and (2)Â the development and
application of more advanced retrieval systems and the utilization of
additional or more frequent auxiliary data which often undergo regular
updates themselves.</p>
      <p id="d1e409">In the last few decades, activities to process and reprocess global,
high-quality cloud property datasets based on long-term sEtellite measurement
records have been undertaken with increased effort. The backbone of most of
the multi-decadal climate datasets of cloud properties has been the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar Operational Environmental
Satellites (POES) series. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) has been on board the NOAA satellites since the end of the 1970s
(i.e. NOAA-5 and beyond). AVHRR is a passive imaging sensor, where the source
of measured radiation is not emitted by the instrument. Instead, the upwards
reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation is measured at the top of the
atmospher and the
Environmental Satellite (Envisat), that carry AVHRR heritage sensors. These
are the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the
Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSR-1/2) and the Advanced Along-Track
Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), which provide an increased number of spectral
channels as well as higher spatial resolution (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M3" display="inline"><mml:mo>â‰¤</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>â€¯1â€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M4" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> footprint
size) than AVHRR. The cloud datasets derived from these measurement records
cover more than one decade and are thus becoming useful for climate studies.
Examples of related cloud property datasets are the Global Retrieval of ATSR
cloud Parameters and Evaluation <xref ref-type}"bibr" rid="bib1.bibx43" id="paren.4"><named-content content-type="pre">ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.(2008)</label><mixed-citaGRAPE;</named-content></xref> for
ATSR/AATSR, the NASA MODIS Collection 5
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx36 bib1.bibx25" id="paren.5"/> and Collection 6
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx2 bib1.bibx37 bib1.bibx38 bib1.bibx28" id="paren.6"/>.
The MODIS and ATSR/AATSR sensors include the spectral channels of AVHRR but
have additional ones in the visible, near-infrared and, in the case of MODIS,
also in the thermal infrared. However, even when restricted to the AVHRR
heritage channels, their increased spatial resolution as well as their
contribution to increasing the observation frequency motivates their
consideration in climate research, in particular in conjunction with AVHRR.</p>
      <p id="d1e455">Most of the aforementioned cloud property datasets have improved over the
years and have now reached quality levels that facilitate qualitative and
quantitative assessments of clouds in the Earth's climate system
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx32 bib1.bibx49 bib1.bibx8 bnd cloud processes and
the evaluation of atmospheric models. However, there is still potential for
advancing such datasets.</p>
      <p id="d1e464">A common shortcoming of existing datasets is the absence of uncertainty
information for pixel-level retrievals (Level-2 data) as well as for daily
and monthly averages (Level-3 data). These uncertainties should be derived
usrng a mathematically sound framework with uncertainty propagation. Another
improvement to cloud property datasets is to ensure that the properties
retrieved using mainly shortwave measurements are radiatively consistent with
those mainly based on thermal infrared measurements. This is known as
spectral consistency and is important to ensure that subsequent simulations
of TOA radiances using these retrieved cloud properties match the measured
radiances in all spectral bands. The same can be inferred for TOA broad-band
fluxes produced using the retrieved parameters. Spectral consistency is not
maintained in existing cloud retrievals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx14" id="paren.8"><named-content content-type="pre">e.g.</named-content></xref>
despite being of particular importance to, for example, studies investigating
the impact of cloud properties and their change on TOA broadband fluxes and
latent heating rates.</p>
      <p id="d1e472">The ESA Cloud_cci project covers the cloud component within ESA's Climate
Change Initiative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx20/ id="paren.9"/>. The overarching aim of the ESA
Cloud_cci project has been the generation of state-of-the-art cloud property

investigation of their synergistic capabilities. This was achieved by

derive a set of cloud variables simultaneously using the visible,
near-infrared and thermal infrared measurements. The retrieval systems were
used to generate cloud property datasets spanning the entire available
measurement record from 1982 until 2014. In the first phase of Cloud_cci

presenting a concise overview of the most important technical and scientific
aspects. SectionÂ <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Ch1.S2"/> gives an overview of the

    <!--<article-title-html>Cloud property datasets retrieved from AVHRR, MODIS, AATSR and MERIS in the framework of the Cloud_cci project</article-title-html>
<abstract-html><p class="p">New cloud property datasets based on measurements from the passive
imaging satellite sensors AVHRR, MODIS, ATSR2, AATSR and MERIS are presented.
Two retrieval systems were developed that include components for cloud
detection and cloud typing followed by cloud property retrievals based on the
optimal estimation (OE) technique. The OE-based retrievals are applied to
simultaneously retrieve cloud-top pressure, cloud particle effective radius
and cloud optical thickness using measurements at visible, near-infrared and
thermal infrared wavelengths, which ensures spectral consistency. The
retrieved cloud properties are further processed to derive cloud-top height,
cloud-top temperature, cloud liquid water path, cloud ice water path and
spectral cloud albedo. The Cloud_cci products are pixel-based retrievals,
