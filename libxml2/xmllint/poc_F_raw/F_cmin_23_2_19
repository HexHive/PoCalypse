2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and
comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
chaage expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan CLnnolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),
add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee et al.),
move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fr((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((eaking, and are NOT legal in

Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOT DONE YET:
change binary / text to unparsed / parsed.
handle James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values
uppercase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate
recent WG decisions and other corrections:
binding sources of character encoding info (27 Aug / 3 Sept),
correct wording of Faust quotatiot (restore dropped line),
drop SDD from EncodingDecl,
change text at version number 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,

change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normalization in public identifiers,
add description of how to generate our name-space rules from 
Unicode character database (needs further work!).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>

<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with
SGML TC (as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first iX an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic chtnges,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for igiored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs fi‡ding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating t element content (?).

Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on

for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>

</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't requir‚ exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.

suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments Cre /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references;

Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documents.
</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <tp of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Applicat_on">It is assumed that an XML processor is
doing its work on behalf of another0module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the arspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>
<p>This version of the XML specification
<!-- is for &doc.audience;.-->

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>may</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML
processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>must</label>
<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.
<!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->
</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>error</label>
<def><p><termdef id='dt-error' term='Error'
>A violation of the rules of this
specification; results are
undefined.  Conforming software may detect and report an error and may
recover from it.</termdef></p></def>
</gitref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref>
must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the
processor may continue
processing the data to search for further errors and may report such
errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.e., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).
</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>at user option</label>
<def><p>Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in the
sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must
provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>validity constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all 
<termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents.
Violations of validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, 
be reported by 
<termref def="dt-validating">validating XML processors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>well-formedness constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all <termref
def="dt-wellformed">well-formed</termref> XML documents.
Violations of well-formedness constraints are 
<termref def="dt-fatal">fatal errors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>

<gitem>
<label>match</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-match" term="match">(Of strings or names:) 
Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g.
characters with 
both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the
same repreings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some canonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
(Of content and content models:)
An element matches its declaration when it conforms
in the fashion described in the constraint
<specref ref='elementvalid'/>.

<!--*  readers (notably JC) find the following
paragraph awkward and redundant.  I agree it's logically redundant:
it *says* it is summarizing the logical implications of
matching the grammar, and that means by definition it's
logically redundant.  I don't think it's rhetorically
redundant or unnecessary, though, so I'm keeping it.  It
could however use some recasting when the editors are feeling
stronger. -MSM *-->

<p>Before there was an official standard for C, many users and implementors relied on an informal specification contained in a book by <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie" title="Dennis Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brian_Kernighan" title="Brian Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a>; that version is generally referred to as "K&amp;R" C. In 1989 the <a href="/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> published a standard for C (generally called "<a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a>" or "C89"). The next year, the same specification was approved by the <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> as an international standard (generally called "C90"). ISO later released an extension to the <a href="/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" title="Internationalization and localization">internationalization</a> support of the standard in 1995, and a revised standard (known as "<a href="/wiki/C99" title="C99">C99</a>") in 1999. The current version of the standard (now known as "<a href="/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)" title="C11 (C standard revision)">C11</a>") was approved in December 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
