</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic chtnges,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for igiored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs fi‡ding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating t element content (?).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft:
Add text for draconian error handling (introduce
the term Fatal Error).
RE deleta est (changing wording from 
original announcement to restrict the requirement to validating
parsers).
Tag definition of validating processor and link to it.

<sitem>1997-03-31Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),

declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'

<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.

suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments are /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &DSD references;
introduce some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>

reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documents.
</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <tp of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Application">It is assumed that an XML processor is
doing its work on behalf of another0module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the arspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>may</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML
processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>must</label>
<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.
<!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->
</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>error</label>
<def><p><termdef id='dt-error' term='Error'
>A violation of the rules of this
specification; results are
undefined.  Conforming software may detect and report an error and may
recover from it.</termdef></p></def>
</gitref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref>
must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the
processor may continue
processing the data to search for further errors and may report such
errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.e., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).
</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>at user option</label>
<def><p>Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in the
sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must
provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>validity constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all 
<termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents.
Violations of validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, 
be reported by 
<termref def="dt-validating">validating XML processors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>well-formedness constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all <termref
def="dt-wellformed">well-formed</termref> XML documents.
Violations of well-formedness constraints are 
<termref def="dt-fatal">fatal errors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>

<gitem>
<label>match</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-match" term="match">(Of strings or names:) 
Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g.
characters with 
both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the
same repreings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some canonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
(Of content and content models:)
An element matches its declaration when it conforms
in the fashion described in the constraint

<p>C is an <a href="/wiki/Imperative_programming" title="Imperative programming">imperative</a> (<a href="/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural programming">procedural</a>) language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal <a href="/wiki/Run-time_system" title="Run-time system">run-time support</a>. C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>, such as in <a href="/wiki/System_programming" title="System programming">system programming</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage <a href="/wiki/Cross-platform" title="Cross-platform">cross-platform</a> programming. A standards-compliant and <a href="/wiki/Porting" title="Porting">portably</a> written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded <a href="/wiki/Microcontroller" title="Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a> to <a href="/wiki/Supercomputer" title="Supercomputer">supercomputers</a>.</p>

<p>Like most imperative languages in the <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> tradition, C has facilities for <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming" title="Structured programming">structured programming</a> and allows <a href="/wiki/Scope_(programming)" title="Scope (programming)" class="mw-redirect">lexical variable scope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Recursion" title="Recursion">recursion</a>, while a static <a href="/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a> prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within <a href="/wiki/Subroutines" title="Subroutines" class="mw-redirect">subroutines</a>, which are called "functions" (although not in the strict sense of <a href="/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional programming">functional programming</a>). Function <a href="/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science)" title="Parameter (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">parameters</a> are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing <a href="/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointer</a> values. C program source text is <a href="/wiki/Free-form_language" title="Free-form language">free-format</a>, using the <a href="/wiki/Semicolon" title="Semicolon">semicolon</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Statement_(programming)" title="Statement (programming)" class="mw-redirect">statement</a> terminator and <a href="/wiki/Curly_braces#Curly_brackets_.7B_.7D" title="Curly braces" class="mw-redirect">curly braces</a> for grouping blocks of statements.</p>
<p>The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of <a href="/wiki/Flow_of_control" title="Flow of control" class="mw-redirect">flow of control</a> primitives: <code><a href="/wiki/For_loop" title="For loop">for</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Conditional_(programming)" title="Conditional (programming)" class="mw-redirect">if/else</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/While_loop" title="While loop">while</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Switch_statement" title="Switch statement">switch</a></code>, and <code><a href="/wiki/Do_while_loop" title="Do while loop">do/while</a></code>. There is one <a href="/wiki/Namespace" title="Namespace">namespace</a>, and user-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of <a href="/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)" title="Sigil (computer programming)">sigil</a>.</li>
<li>There are a large number of arithmetical and logical operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code>, etc.</li>
<li>More than one <a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> may be performed in a single statement.</li>
<li>Function return values can be ignored when not needed.</li>
<li>Typing is <a href="/wiki/Static_typing" title="Static typing" class="mw-redirect">static</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Weak_typing" title="Weak typing" class="mw-redirect">weakly enforced</a>: all data has a type, but implicit conversions can be performed; for instance, characters can be used as integers.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Declaration_(computer_programming)" title="Declaration (computer programming)">Declaration</a> <a href="/wiki/C_syntax" title="C syntax">syntax</a> mimics usage context. C has no "define" keyword; instead, a statement beginning with the name of a type is taken as a declaration.

<li>User-defined (<code>typedef</code>) and compound types are possible.
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous aggregate data types (<code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code>) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">Array</a> indexing is a secondary notion, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic.

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, developers of the C programming language.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a <a href="/wiki/PDP-7" title="PDP-7">PDP-7</a> by Ritchie and Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually they decided to port the operating system to a <a href="/wiki/PDP-11" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was developed in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>. The developers were considering to rewrite the system using the <a href="/wiki/B_language" title="B language" class="mw-redirect">B language</a>. However B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably <a href="/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a> addressability, led to the development of C.</p>
<p>The initial development of C occurred at <a href="/wiki/AT%26T_Bell_Labs" title="AT&amp;T Bell Labs" class="mw-redirect">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a> between 1969 and 1973;<sup id="cite_ref-dottcl_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dottcl-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> according to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972. At that year a great part of Unix was rewritten in C.<sup id="cite_ref-Stallings_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stallings-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> By 1973, with the addition of <code>struct</code> types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> <a href="/wiki/Kernel_(computing)" title="Kernel (computing)">kernel</a> was now in C. The new language was named "C" because its features were derived from "<a href="/wiki/B_(programming_language)" title="B (programming language)">B</a>", which according to <a href="/wiki/Ken_Thompson_(computer_programmer)" title="Ken Thompson (computer programmer)" class="mw-redirect">Ken Thompson</a> was a stripped-down version of the <a href="/wiki/BCPL" title="BCPL">BCPL</a> programming language.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly</a>. (Earlier instances include the <a href="/wiki/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a> system (written in <a href="/wiki/PL/I" title="PL/I">PL/I</a>), and MCP (<a href="/wiki/MCP_(Burroughs_Large_Systems)" title="MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)" class="mw-redirect">Master Control Program</a>) for the <a href="/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems" title="Burroughs large systems">Burroughs B5000</a> written in <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> in 1961.) Circa 1977, further changes to the language were made by Ritchie and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Johnson" title="Stephen C. Johnson">Stephen C. Johnson</a> to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson's <a href="/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler" title="Portable C Compiler">Portable C Compiler</a> served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.<sup id="cite_ref-unixport_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-unixport-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="K.26R_C">K&amp;R C</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: K&amp;R C">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In 1978, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Kernighan" title="Brian Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie" title="Dennis Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> published the first edition of <i><a href="/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" title="The C Programming Language">The C Programming Language</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r1e_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r1e-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> This book, known to C programmers as "K&amp;R", served for many years as an informal <a href="/wiki/Specification" title="Specification" class="mw-redirect">specification</a> of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as <i>K&amp;R C</i>. The second edition of the book<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r2e_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r2e-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> covers the later <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a> standard.</p>
<p>K&amp;R introduced several language features:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard I/O library</li>
<li><code>long int</code> data type</li>
<li><code>unsigned int</code> data type</li>
<li>compound assignment operators of the form <code>=</code><i>op</i> (such as <code>=-</code>) were changed to the form <i>op</i><code>=</code> to remove the semantic ambiguity created by such constructs as <code>i=-10</code>, which had been interpreted as <code>i&#160;=-&#160;10</code> (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended <code>i&#160;=&#160;-10</code> (let i be -10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after the publication of the 1989 C standard, for many years K&amp;R C was still considered the "<a href="/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator_(computers)" title="Lowest common denominator (computers)" class="mw-redirect">lowest common denominator</a>" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&amp;R C code can be legal Standard C as well.</p>
<p>In early versions of C, only functions that returned a non-<code>int</code> value needed to be declared if used before the function definition; a function used without any previous declaration was assumed to return type <code>int</code>, if its value was used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="cpp source-cpp">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw4">long</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
 
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> calling_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
    <span class="kw4">long</span> test1<span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw4">register</span> <span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
 
    test1 <span class="sy1">=</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">if</span> <span class="br0">(</span>test1 <span class="sy1">&gt;</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="br0">)</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">else</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">return</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>int</code> type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K&amp;R C, but are required in later standards.</p>
<p>Since K&amp;R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter <a href="/wiki/Type_checking" title="Type checking" class="mw-redirect">type cheks</a> were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if multiple calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments. Separate tools such as Unix's <a href="/wiki/Lint_programming_tool" title="Lint programming tool" class="mw-redirect">lint</a> utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.</p>
<p>In the years following the publication of K&amp;R C, several unofficial features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&amp;T and some other vendors. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="/wiki/Void_type" title="Void type">void</a></code> functions (i.e. functions with no return value)</li>
<li>functions returning <code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code> or <code><a href="/wiki/Union_(computer_science)" title="Union (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">union</a></code> types (rather than pointers)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> for <code>struct</code> data types</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enumerated_type" title="Enumerated type">enumerated types</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a <a href="/wiki/C_standard_library" title="C standard library">standard library</a>, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&amp;R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a></div>
<p>During the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframe computers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer" title="Minicomputer">minicomputers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer" title="Microcomputer">microcomputers</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC" class="mw-redirect">IBM PC</a>, as its popularity began to increase significantly.</p>
<p>In 1983, the <a href="/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</a> <a href="/wiki/Working_group" title="Working group">working group</a> 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 <a href="/wiki/POSIX" title="POSIX">POSIX</a> standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C". This version of the language is often referred to as <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a>, Standard C, or sometimes C89.</p>
<p>In 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to the same programming language.</p>
<p>ANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group <a href="/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC1/SC22" title="ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22</a>/WG14. National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a <a href="/wiki/Superset" title="Superset" class="mw-redirect">superset</a> of K&amp;R C, incorporating many of the unofficial features subsequently introduced. The standards committee also included several additional features such as <a href="/wiki/Function_prototype" title="Function prototype">function prototypes</a> (borrowed from C++), <code>void</code> pointers, support for international <a href="/wiki/Character_encoding" title="Character encoding">character sets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Locale" title="Locale">locales</a>, and preprocessor enhancements. Although the <a href="/wiki/C_syntax" title="C syntax">syntax</a> for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C++, the K&amp;R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code.</p>
<p>C89 is supported by current C compilers, and most C code being written today is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any <a href="/wiki/System_platform" title="System platform" class="mw-redirect">platform</a> with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits. Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">GUI</a> libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte <a href="/wiki/Endianness" title="Endianness">endianness</a>.</p>
<p>In cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K&amp;R C-based compilers, the <code>__STDC__</code> macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K&amp;R sections to prevent the use on a K&amp;R C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C.</p>

<p>After the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995 Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets. The C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as "<a href="/wiki/C99" title="C99">C99</a>". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda.<sup id="cite_ref-AutoTX-5_15-0" class="refe//www.xsltfunctions.com/xsl/functx_next-day.html

the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not

<!--*  readers (notably JC) find the following
paragraph awkward and redundant.  I agree it's logically redundant:
it *says* it is summarizing the logical implications of
matching the grammar, and that means by definition it's
logically redundant.  I don't think it's rhetorically
redundant or unnecessary, though, so I'm keeping it.  It
could however use some recasting when the editors are feeling
stronger. -MSM *-->

In 1989 the <a href="/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> published a standard for C (generally called "<a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a>" or "C89"). The next year, the same specification was approved by the <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> as an international standard (generally called "C90"). ISO later released an extension to the <a href="/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization" title="Internationalization and localization">internationalization</a> support of the standard in 1995, and a revised standard (known as "<a href="/wiki/C99" title="C99">C99</a>") in 1999. The current version of the standard (now known as "<a href="/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)" title="C11 (C standard revision)">C11</a>") was approved in December 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</s‡an>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
