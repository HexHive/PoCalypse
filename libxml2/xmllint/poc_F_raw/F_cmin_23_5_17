about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),

move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',

Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOT DONE YET:
change binary / text to unparsed / parsed.
handle James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values
uppercase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate
recent WG decisions and other corrections:
binding sources of character encoding info (27 Aug / 3 Sept),
correct wording of Faust quotatiot (restore dropped line),
drop SDD from EncodingDecl,
change text at version number 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,

change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normalization in public identifiers,
add description of how to generate our name-space rules from 
Unicode character database (needs further work!).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>

<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with
SGML TC (as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first iX an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic chtnges,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for igiored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs fi‡ding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.

Add colon as name character.
Change def of %operator.
Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on

for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : CMSMcQ : correct as manyreported errors as possible.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.

ERB decision re EMPTY.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-28 : TB : Change DTD.  Implement some of Michael's
suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments are /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references;
introduce some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>

Replace a few literals with xmlpio and
pic entities, to make them consistent and ensure we can change pic
reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documents.
</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <tp of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Application">It is assumed that an XML processor is
doing its work on behalf of another0module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the arspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>
<p>This version of the XML specification
<!-- is for &doc.audience;.-->

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>may</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML
processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>must</label>
<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.
<!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->
</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>error</label>
<def><p><termdef id='dt-error' term='Error'
>A violation of the rules of this
specification; results are
undefined.  Conforming software may detect and report an error and may
recover from it.</termdef></p></def>
</gitref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref>
must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the
processor may continue
processing the data to search for further errors and may report such
errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.e., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).
</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>at user option</label>
<def><p>Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in the
sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must
provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>validity constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all 
<termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents.
Violations of validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, 
be reported by 
<termref def="dt-validating">validating XML processors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>well-formedness constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all <termref
def="dt-wellformed">well-formed</termref> XML documents.
Violations of well-formedness constraints are 
<termref def="dt-fatal">fatal errors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>

<gitem>
<label>match</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-match" term="match">(Of strings or names:) 
Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g.
characters with 
both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the
same repreings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some canonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
(Of content and content models:)
An element matches its declaration when it conforms
in the fashion described in the constraint
<specref ref='elementvalid'/>.

<p>C is an <a href="/wiki/Imperative_programming" title="Imperative programming">imperative</a> (<a href="/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural programming">procedural</a>) language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal <a href="/wiki/Run-time_system" title="Run-time system">run-time support</a>. C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>, such as in <a href="/wiki/System_programming" title="System programming">system programming</a>.</p>
<p>Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage <a href="/wiki/Cross-platform" title="Cross-platform">cross-platform</a> programming. A standards-compliant and <a href="/wiki/Porting" title="Porting">portably</a> written C program can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded <a href="/wiki/Microcontroller" title="Microcontroller">microcontrollers</a> to <a href="/wiki/Supercomputer" title="Supercomputer">supercomputers</a>.</p>

<p>Like most imperative languages in the <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> tradition, C has facilities for <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming" title="Structured programming">structured programming</a> and allows <a href="/wiki/Scope_(programming)" title="Scope (programming)" class="mw-redirect">lexical variable scope</a> and <a href="/wiki/Recursion" title="Recursion">recursion</a>, while a static <a href="/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a> prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within <a href="/wiki/Subroutines" title="Subroutines" class="mw-redirect">subroutines</a>, which are called "functions" (although not in the strict sense of <a href="/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional programming">functional programming</a>). Function <a href="/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science)" title="Parameter (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">parameters</a> are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing <a href="/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointer</a> values. C program source text is <a href="/wiki/Free-form_language" title="Free-form language">free-format</a>, using the <a href="/wiki/Semicolon" title="Semicolon">semicolon</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Statement_(programming)" title="Statement (programming)" class="mw-redirect">statement</a> terminator and <a href="/wiki/Curly_braces#Curly_brackets_.7B_.7D" title="Curly braces" class="mw-redirect">curly braces</a> for grouping blocks of statements.</p>
<p>The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of <a href="/wiki/Flow_of_control" title="Flow of control" class="mw-redirect">flow of control</a> primitives: <code><a href="/wiki/For_loop" title="For loop">for</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Conditional_(programming)" title="Conditional (programming)" class="mw-redirect">if/else</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/While_loop" title="While loop">while</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Switch_statement" title="Switch statement">switch</a></code>, and <code><a href="/wiki/Do_while_loop" title="Do while loop">do/while</a></code>. There is one <a href="/wiki/Namespace" title="Namespace">namespace</a>, and user-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of <a href="/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)" title="Sigil (computer programming)">sigil</a>.</li>
<li>There are a large number of arithmetical and logical operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code>, etc.</li>
<li>More than one <a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> may be performed in a single statement.</li>
<li>Function return values can be ignored when not needed.</li>
<li>Typing is <a href="/wiki/Static_typing" title="Static typing" class="mw-redirect">static</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Weak_typing" title="Weak typing" class="mw-redirect">weakly enforced</a>: all data has a type, but implicit conversions can be performed; for instance, characters can be used as integers.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Declaration_(computer_programming)" title="Declaration (computer programming)">Declaration</a> <a href="/wiki/C_syntax" title="C syntax">syntax</a> mimics usage context. C has no "define" keyword; instead, a statement beginning with the name of a type is taken as a declaration.

<li>User-defined (<code>typedef</code>) and compound types are possible.
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous aggregate data types (<code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code>) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">Array</a> indexing is a secondary notion, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic.

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, developers of the C programming language.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a <a href="/wiki/PDP-7" title="PDP-7">PDP-7</a> by Ritchie and Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually they decided to port the operating system to a <a href="/wiki/PDP-11" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was developed in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>. The developers were considering to rewrite the system using the <a href="/wiki/B_language" title="B language" class="mw-redirect">B language</a>. However B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably <a href="/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a> addressability, led to the development of C.</p>
<p>The initial development of C occurred at <a href="/wiki/AT%26T_Bell_Labs" title="AT&amp;T Bell Labs" class="mw-redirect">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a> between 1969 and 1973;<sup id="cite_ref-dottcl_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dottcl-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> according to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972. At that year a great part of Unix was rewritten in C.<sup id="cite_ref-Stallings_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stallings-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> By 1973, with the addition of <code>struct</code> types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> <a href="/wiki/Kernel_(computing)" title="Kernel (computing)">kernel</a> was now in C. The new language was named "C" because its features were derived from "<a href="/wiki/B_(programming_language)" title="B (programming language)">B</a>", which according to <a href="/wiki/Ken_Thompson_(computer_programmer)" title="Ken Thompson (computer programmer)" class="mw-redirect">Ken Thompson</a> was a stripped-down version of the <a href="/wiki/BCPL" title="BCPL">BCPL</a> programming language.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly</a>. (Earlier instances include the <a href="/wiki/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a> system (written in <a href="/wiki/PL/I" title="PL/I">PL/I</a>), and MCP (<a href="/wiki/MCP_(Burroughs_Large_Systems)" title="MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)" class="mw-redirect">Master Control Program</a>) for the <a href="/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems" title="Burroughs large systems">Burroughs B5000</a> written in <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> in 1961.) Circa 1977, further changes to the language were made by Ritchie and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Johnson" title="Stephen C. Johnson">Stephen C. Johnson</a> to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson's <a href="/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler" title="Portable C Compiler">Portable C Compiler</a> served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.<sup id="cite_ref-unixport_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-unixport-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="K.26R_C">K&amp;R C</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: K&amp;R C">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In 1978, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Kernighan" title="Brian Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie" title="Dennis Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> published the first edition of <i><a href="/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" title="The C Programming Language">The C Programming Language</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r1e_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r1e-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> This book, known toC programmers as "K&amp;R", served for many years as an informal <a hre€"/wiki/Specification" title="Specification" class="mw-redirect">specification</a> of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as <i>K&amp;R C</i>. The second edition of the book<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r2e_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r2e-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> covers the later <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a> standard.</p>
<p>K&amp;R introduced several language features:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard I/O library</li>
<li><code>long int</code> data type</li>
<li><code>unsigned int</code> data type</li>
<li>compound assignment operators of the form <code>=</code><i>op</i> (such as <code>=-</code>) were changed to the form <i>op</i><code>=</code> to remove the semantic ambiguity created by such constructs as <code>i=-10</code>, which had been interpreted as <code>i&#160;=-&#160;10</code> (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended <code>i&#160;=&#160;-10</code> (let i be -10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after the publication of the 1989 C standard, for many years K&amp;R C was still considered the "<a href="/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator_(computers)" title="Lowest common denominator (computers)" class="mw-redirect">lowest common denominator</a>" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&amp;R C code can be legal Standard C as well.</p>
<p>In early versions of C, only functions that returned a non-<code>int</code> value needed to be declared if used before the function definition; a function used without any previous declaration was assumed to return type <code>int</code>, if its value was used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="cpp source-cpp">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw4">long</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
 
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> calling_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
    <span class="kw4">long</span> test1<span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw4">register</span> <span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
 
    test1 <span class="sy1">=</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">if</span> <span class="br0">(</span>test1 <span class="sy1">&gt;</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="br0">)</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">else</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">return</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>int</code> type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K&amp;R C, but are required in later standards.</p>
<p>Since K&amp;R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter <a href="/wiki/Type_checking" title="Type checking" class="mw-redirect">type checks</a> were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if multiple calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments. Separate tools such as Unix's <a href="/wiki/Lint_programming_tool" title="Lint programming tool" class="mw-redirect">lint</a> utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.</p>
<p>In the years following the publication of K&amp;R C, several unofficial features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&amp;T and some other vendors. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="/wiki/Void_type" title="Void type">void</a></code> functions (i.e. functions with no return value)</li>
<li>functions returning <code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code> or <code><a href="/wiki/Union_(computer_science)" title="Union (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">union</a></code> types (rather than pointers)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> for <code>struct</code> data types</li>

<p>The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a <a href="/wiki/C_standard_library" title="C standard library">standard library</a>, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&amp;R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a></div>
<p>During the late 1970s and 1980s, versions of C were implemented for a wide variety of <a href="/wiki/Mainframe_computer" title="Mainframe computer">mainframe computers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minicomputer" title="Minicomputer">minicomputers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Microcomputer" title="Microcomputer">microcomputers</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/IBM_PC" title="IBM PC" class="mw-redirect">IBM PC</a>, as its popularity began to increase significantly.</p>
<p>In 1983, the <a href="/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute" title="American National Standards Institute">American National Standards Institute</a> (ANSI) formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. X3J11 based the C standard on the Unix implementation; however, the non-portable portion of the Unix C library was handed off to the <a href="/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</a> <a href="/wiki/Working_group" title="Working group">working group</a> 1003 to become the basis for the 1988 <a href="/wiki/POSIX" title="POSIX">POSIX</a> standard. In 1989, the C standard was ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C". This version of the language is often referred to as <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a>, Standard C, or sometimes C89.</p>
<p>In 1990, the ANSI C standard (with formatting changes) was adopted by the <a href="/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization" title="International Organization for Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, which is sometimes called C90. Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to the same programming language.</p>
<p>ANSI, like other national standards bodies, no longer develops the C standard independently, but defers to the international C standard, maintained by the working group <a href="/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC1/SC22" title="ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22">ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22</a>/WG14. National adoption of an update to the international standard typically occurs within a year of ISO publication.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the C standardization process was to produce a <a href="/wiki/Superset" title="Superset" class="mw-redirect">superset</a> of K&amp;R C, incorporating many of the unofficial features subsequently introduced. The standards committee also included several additional features such as <a href="/wiki/Function_prototype" title="Function prototype">function prototypes</a> (borrowed from C++), <code>void</code> pointers, support for international <a href="/wiki/Character_encoding" title="Character encoding">character sets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Locale" title="Locale">locales</a>, and preprocessor enhancements. Although the <a href="/wiki/C_syntax" title="C syntax">syntax</a> for parameter declarations was augmented to include the style used in C++, the K&amp;R interface continued to be permitted, for compatibility with existing source code.</p>
<p>C89 is supported by current C compilers, and most C code being written today is based on it. Any program written only in Standard C and without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any <a href="/wiki/System_platform" title="System platform" class="mw-redirect">platfbrm</a> with a conforming C implementation, within its resource limits. Without such precautions, programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as <a href="/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" title="Graphical user interface">GUI</a> libraries, or to a reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of data types and byte <a href="/wiki/Endianness" title="Endianness">endianness</a>.</p>
<p>In cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming or K&amp;R C-based compilers, the <code>__STDC__</code> macro can be used to split the code into Standard and K&amp;R sections to prevent the use on a K&amp;R C-based compiler of features available only in Standard C.</p>

<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/C99" title="C99">C99</a></div>
<p>After the ANSI/ISO standardization process, the C language specification remained relatively static for several years. In 1995 Normative Amendment 1 to the 1990 C standard (ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995, known informally as C95) was published, to correct some details and to add more extensive support for international character sets. The C standard was further revised in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which is commonly referred to as "<a href="/wiki/C99" title="C99">C99</a>". It has since been amended three times by Technical Corrigenda.<sup id="cite_ref-AutoTX-5_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AutoTX-5-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>C99 introduced several new features, including <a href="/wiki/Inline_function" title="Inline function">inline functions</a>, several new <a href="/wiki/Data_type" title="Data type">data types</a> (including <code>long long int</code> and a <code>complex</code> type to represent <a href="/wiki/Complex_number" title="Complex number">complex numbers</a>), <a href="/wiki/Variable-length_array" title="Variable-length array">variable-length arrays</a>, improved support for <a href="/wiki/IEEE_754" title="IEEE 754" class="mw-redirect">IEEE 754</a> floating point, support for <a href="/wiki/Variadic_macro" title="Variadic macro">variadic macros</a> (macros of variable <a href="/wiki/Arity" title="Arity">arity</a>), and support for one-line comments beginning with <code>//</code>, as in <a href="/wiki/BCPL" title="BCPL">BCPL</a> or C++. Many of these had already been implemented as extensions in several C compilers.</p>
<p>C99 is for the most part backward compatible with C90, but is stricter in some ways; in particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has <code>int</code> implicitly assumed. A standard macro <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> is defined with value <code>199901L</code> to indicate that C99 support is available. <a href="/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection" title="GNU Compiler Collection">GCC</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sun_Studio_(software)" title="Sun Studio (software)" class="mw-redirect">Solaris Studio</a>, and other C compilers now support many or all of the new features of C99. The C compiler in <a href="/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_C%2B%2B" title="Microsoft Visual C++" class="mw-redirect">Microsoft Visual C++</a>, however, implements the C89 standard and those parts of C99 that are required for compatibility with <a href="/wiki/C%2B%2B11" title="C++11">C++11</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called "C1X" until its official publication on 2011-12-08. The C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.</p>
<p>The C11 standard adds numerous new features to C and the library, including type generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading, and bounds-checked functions.

<p>Historically, embedded C programming requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support exotic features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations.</p>
<p>In 2008, the C Standards Committee published a technical report extending the C language<sup id="cite_ref-AutoTX-6_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AutoTX-6-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> to address these issues by providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to.

Comments may appear either between the delimiters <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>, or (since C99) following <code>//</code> until the end of the line.

<p>C source files contain declarations and function definitions. Function definitions, in turn, contain declarations and <a href="/wiki/Statement_(programming)" title="Statement (programming)" class="mw-redirect">statements</a>. Declarations either define new types using keywords such as <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, and <code>enum</code>, or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type followed by the variable name. Keywords such as <code>char</code> and <code>int</code> specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>, sometimes called "curly brackets") to limit the scope of declarations and to act as a single statement for control structures.</p>
<p>As an imperative language, C uses <i>statements</i> to specify actions. The most common statement is an <i>expression statement</i>, consisting of an expression to be evaluated, followed by a semicolon; as a side effect of the evaluation, functions may be <a href="/wiki/Procedure_call" title="Procedure call" class="mw-redirect">called</a> €nd variables may be <a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assigned</a> new values. To modify the normal sequential execution of statements, C provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords. <a href="/wiki/Structured_programming" title="Structured programming">Structured programming</a> is supported by <code>if</code>(-<code>else</code>) conditional execution and by <code>do</code>-<code>while</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code> iterative execution (looping). The <code>for</code> statement has separate initialization, testing, and reinitialization expressions, any or all of which can be omitted. <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> can be used to leave the innermost enclosing loop statement or skip to its reinitialization. There is also a non-structured <code><a href="/wiki/Goto" title="Goto">goto</a></code> statement which branches directly to the designated <a href="/wiki/Label_(programming_language)" title="Label (programming language)" class="mw-redirect">label</a> within the function. <code>switch</code> selects a <code>case</code> to be executed based on the value of an integer expression.</p>
<p>Expressions can use a variety of built-in operators and may contain function calls. The order in which arguments to functions and operands to most operators are evaluated is unspecified. The evaluations may even be interleaved. However, all side effects (including storage to variables) will occur before the next "<a href="/wiki/Sequence_point" title="Sequence point">sequence point</a>"; sequence points include the end of each expression statement, and the entry to and return from each function call. Sequence points also occur during evaluation of expressions containing certain operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code><a href="/wiki/%3F:" title="?:">?:</a></code> and the <a href="/wiki/Comma_operator" title="Comma operator">comma operator</a>). This permits a high degree of object code optimization by the compiler, but requires C programmers to take more care to obtain reliable results than is needed for other programming languages.</p>
<p>Kernighan and Ritchie say in the Introduction of <i>The C Programming Language</iA: "C, like any other language, has its blemishes. Some of the operators have the wrong precedence; some parts of the syntax could be better."<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The C standard did not attempt to correct many of these blemishes, because of the impact of such changes on already existing software.</p>

<p>Most of the recently added keywords begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter, because identifiers of that form were previously reserved by the C standard for use only by implementations. Since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers, it would not be affected when C implementations started supporting these extensions to the programming language. Some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers.

<p>The first line of the program contains a <a href="/wiki/Preprocessing" title="Preprocessing" class="mw-redirect">preprocessing directive</a>, indicated by <code>#include</code>. This causes the compiler to replace that line with the entire text of the <code><a href="/wiki/Stdio.h" title="Stdio.h" class="mw-redirect">stdio.h</a></code> standard header, which contains declarations for standard input and output functions such as <code>printf</code>. The angle brackets surrounding <code>stdio.h</code> indicate that <code>stdio.h</code> is located using a search strategy that prefers standard headers to other headers having the same name. (Double quotes are used to include local or project-specific header files.)</p>
<p>The next line indicates that a function named <code>main</code> is being defined. The <code><a href="/wiki/Main_function_(programming)" title="Main function (programming)" class="mw-redirect">main</a></code> function serves a special purpose in C programs; the run-time environment calls the <code>main</code> function to begin program execution. The type specifier <code>int</code> indicates that the value that is returned to the invoker (in this case the run-time environment) as a result of evaluating the <code>main</code> function, is an integer. The keyword <code>void</code> as a parameter list indicates that this function takes no arguments.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>nb 2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The opening curly brace indicates the beginning of the definition of the <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p>The next line <i>calls</i> (diverts execution to) a function named <code><a href="/wiki/Printf" title="Printf" class="mw-redirect">printf</a></code>, which is supplied from a system <a href="/wiki/Library_(computing)" title="Library (computing)">library</a>. In this call, the <code>printf</code> function is <i>passed</i> (provided with) a single argument, the address of the first character in the <a href="/wiki/String_literal" title="String literal">string literal</a> <code>"hello, world\n"</code>. The string literal is an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">array</a> with elements of type <code>char</code>, set up automatically by the compiler with a final 0-valued character to mark the end of the array (<code>printf</code> needs to know this). The <code>\n</code> is an <i>escape sequence</i> that C translates to a <i><a href="/wiki/Newline" title="Newline">newline</a></i> character, which on output signifies the end of the current line. The return value of the <code>printf</code> function is of type <code>int</code>, but it is silently discarded since it is not used. (A more careful program might test the return value to determine whether or not the <code>printf</code> function succeeded.) The semicolon <code>;</code> terminates the statement.</p>
<p>The closing curly brace indicates the end of the code for the <code>main</code> function. According to the C99 specification and newer, <code>main</code> will implicitly return a status of 0 upon reaching the } that terminates the function. This is interpreted by the run-time system as an exit code indicating successful execution.<sup id="cite_ref-bk21st_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bk21st-28"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>C has a static <a href="/wiki/Weak_typing" title="Weak typing" class="mw-redirect">weak typing</a> <a href="/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a> that shares some similarities with that of other <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> descendants such as <a href="/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" title="Pascal (programming language)">Pascal</a>. There are built-in types for integers of various sizes, both signed and unsigned, <a href="/wiki/Floating-point_number" title="Floating-point number" class="mw-redirect">floating-point numbers</a>, characters, and enumerated types (<code>enum</code>). C99 added a <a href="/wiki/Boolean_datatype" title="Boolean datatype" class="mw-redirect">boolean datatype</a>. There are also derived typzs including <a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">arrays</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Record_(computer_science)" title="Record (computer science)">records</a> (<code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code>), and untagged <a href="/wiki/Union_(computer_science)" title="Union (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">unions</a> (<code>union</code>).</p>
<p>C is often used in low-level systems programming where escapes from the type system may be necessary. The compiler attempts to ensure type correctness of most expressions, but the programmer can override the checks in various ways, either by using a <i><a href="/wiki/Type_conversion" title="Type conversion">type cast</a></i> to explicitly convert a value from one type to another, or by using pointers or unions to reinterpret the underlying bits of a data object in some other way.</p>
<p>Some find C's declaration syntax unintuitive, particularly for <a href="/wiki‘Function_pointer" title="Function pointer">function pointers</a>. (Ritchie's idea was to declare identifiers in contexts resembling their use: "<a href="/wiki/Declaration_reflects_use" title="Declaration reflects use" class="mw-redirect">declaration reflects use</a>".)<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>C's <i>usual arithmetic conversions</i> allow for efficient code to be generated, but can sometimes produce unexpected results. For example, a comparison of signed and unsigned integers of equal width requires a conversion of the signed value to unsigned. This can generate unexpected results if the signed value is negative.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pointers">Pointers</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16" title="Edit section: Pointers">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>C supports the use of <a href="/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointers</a>, a type of <a href="/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)" title="Reference (computer science)">reference</a> that records the address or location of an object or function in memory. Pointers can be <i>dereferenced</i> to access data stored at the address pointed to, or to invoke a pointed-to function. Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or <a href="/wiki/Pointer_arithmetic" title="Pointer arithmetic" class="mw-redirect">pointer arithmetic</a>. The run-time representation of a pointer value is typically a raw memory address (perhaps augmented by an offset-within-word field), but since a pointer's type includes the type of the thing pointed to, expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time. Pointer arithmetic is automatically scaled by the size of the pointed-to data type. Pointers are used for many different purposes in C. <a href="/wiki/String_(computer_science)" title="String (computer science)">Text strings</a> are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays of characters. <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation" title="Dynamic memory allocation" class="mw-redirect">Dynamic memory allocation</a> is performed using pointers. Many data types, such as <a href="/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)" title="Tree (data structure)">trees</a>, are commonly implemented as dynamically allocated <code>struct</code> objects linked together using pointers. Pointers to functions are useful for passing functions as arguments to <a href="/wiki/Higher-order_function" title="Higher-order function">higher-order functions</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Qsort" title="Qsort" class="mw-redirect">qsort</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bsearch" title="Bsearch" class="mw-redirect">bsearch</a>) or as <a href="/wiki/Callback_(computer_science)" title="Callback (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">callbacks</a> to be invoked by event handlers.<sup id="cite_ref-bk21st_28-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bk21st-28"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A <i><a href="/wiki/Null_pointer" title="Null pointer" class="mw-redirect">null pointer</a> value</i> explicitly points to no valid location. Dereferencing a null pointer value is undefined, often resulting in a <a href="/wiki/Segmentation_fault" title="Segmentation fault">segmentation fault</a>. Null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such as no "next" pointer in the final node of a <a href="/wiki/Linked_list" title="Linked list">linked list</a>, or as an error indication from functions returning pointers. In appropriate contexts in source code, such as for assigning to a pointer variable, a <i>null pointer constant</i> can be written as <code>0</code>, with or without explicit casting to a pointer type, or as the <code>NULL</code> macro defined by several standard headers. In conditional contexts, null pointer values evaluate to false, while all other pointer values evaluate to true.</p>
<p>Void pointers (<code>void *</code>) point to objects of unspecified type, and can therefore be used as "generic" data pointers. Since the size and type of the pointed-to object is not known, void pointers cannot be dereferenced, nor is pointer arithmetic on them allowed, although they can easily be (and in many contexts implicitly are) converted to and from any other object pointer type.<sup id="cite_ref-bk21st_28-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bk21st-28"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Careless use of pointers is potentially dangerous. Because they are typically unchecked, a pointer variable can be made to point to any arbitrary location, which can cause undesirable effects. Although properly used pointers point to safe places, they can be made to point to unsafe places by using invalid <a href="/wiki/Pointer_arithmetic" title="Pointer arithmetic" class="mw-redirect">pointer arithmetic</a>; the objects they point to may be deallocated and reused (<a href="/wiki/Dangling_pointer" title="Dangling pointer">dangling pointers</a>); they may be used without having been initialized (<a href="/wiki/Wild_pointer" title="Wild pointer" class="mw-redirect">wild pointers</a>); or they may be directly assigned an unsafe value using a cast, union, or through another corrupt pointer. In general, C is permissive in allowing manipulation of and conversion between pointer types, although compilers typically provide options for various levels of checking. Some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive <a href="/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)" title="Reference (computer science)">reference</a> types.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Arrays">Arrays</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17" title="Edit section: Arrays">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p><a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">Array</a> types in C are traditionally of a fixed, static size specified at compile time. (The more recent C99 standard also allows a form of variable-length arrays.) However, it is also possible to allocate a block of memory (of arbitrary size) at run-time, using the standard library's <code>malloc</code> function, and treat it as an array. C's unification of arrays and pointers means that declared arrays and these dynamically allocated simulated arrays are virtually interchangeable.</p>
<p>Since arrays are always accessed (in effect) via pointers, array accesses are typically <i>not</i> checked against the underlying array size, although some compilers may provide <a href="/wiki/Bounds_checking" title="Bounds checking">bounds checking</a> as an option.<sup id="cite_ref-AutoTX-10_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AutoTX-10-30"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup> Array bounds violations are therefore possible and rather common in carelessly written code, and can lead to various repercussions, including illegal memory accesses, corruption of data, <a href="/wiki/Buffer_overflow" title="Buffer overflow">buffer overruns</a>, and run-time exceptions. If bounds checking is desired, it must be done manually.</p>
<p>C does not have a special provision for declaring multidimensional arrays, but rather relies on recursion within the type system to declare arrays of arrays, which effectively accomplishes the same thing. The index values of the resulting "multidimensional array" can be thought of as increasing in <a href="/wiki/Row-major_order" title="Row-major order">row-major order</a>.</p>
<p>Multidimensional arrays are commonly used in numerical algorithms (mainly from applied <a href="/wiki/Linear_algebra" title="Linear algebra">linear algebra</a>) to store matrices. The structure of the C array is well suited to this particular task. However, since arrays are passed merely as pointers, the bounds of the array must be known fixed values or else explicitly passed to any subroutine that requires them, and dynamically sized arrays of arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing. (A workaround for this is to allocate the array with an additional "row vector" of pointers to the columns.)</p>
<p>C99 introduced "variable-length arrays" which address some, but not all, of the issues with ordinary C arrays.</p>

<p>The <i>subscript</i> notation <code>x[i]</code> (where <code>x</code> designates a pointer) is a <a href="/wiki/Syntactic_sugar" title="Syntactic sugar">syntactic sugar</a> for <code>*(x+i)</code>.<sup id="cite_ref-Raymond1996_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Raymond1996-31"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> Taking advantage of the compiler's knowledge of the pointer type, the address that <code>x + i</code> points to is <i>not</i> the base address (pointed to by <code>x</code>) incremented by <code>i</code> <i>bytes,</i> but rather is defined to be the base address incremented by <code>i</code> <i>multiplied by the size of an element</i> that <code>x</code> points to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in most expression contexts (a notable exception is as operand of <code>sizeof</code>), the name of an array is automatically converted to a pointer to the array's first element; thus for an array declared with the name <code>A</code>, <code>A[i]</code> designates the <code>i+1</code><sup>th</sup> element of the array. This also implies that an array is never copied as a whole when named as an argument to a function, but rather only the address of its first element is passed. Therefore, although function calls in C use <a href="/wiki/Call-by-value" title="Call-by-value" class="mw-redirect">pass-by-value</a> semantics, arrays are <i>in effect</i> passed by <a href="/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)" title="Reference (computer science)">reference</a>.</p>
<p>The size of an element can be determined by applying the operator <code><a href="/wiki/Sizeof" title="Sizeof">sizeof</a></code> to any dereferenced element of <code>x</code>, aof x[0]</code>, and the number of elements in a declared array <code>A</code> can be determined as <code>sizeof A / sizeof A[0]</code>. The latter <i>only</i> applies to array names: variables declared with <i>subscripts</i> (<code>int A[20]</code>). Due to the semantics of C, it is not possible to determine the entire size of arrays through pointers to arrays or those created by dynamic allocation (<code><a href="/wiki/Malloc" title="Malloc" class="mw-redirect">malloc</a></code>); code such as <code>sizeof arr / sizeof arr[0]</code> (where <code>arr = A</code> designates a pointer) will not work since the compiler assumes the size of the pointer itself is being requested.<sup id="cite_ref-cfaq623_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cfaq623-32"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cfaq728_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-cfaq728-33"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> Since array name arguments to <code>sizeof</code> are not converted to pointers, they do not exhibit such ambiguity. However, arrays created by dynamic allocation are initialized to pointers rather than true array variables, so they suffer from the same <code>sizeof</code> issues as array pointers.</p>
<p>Thus, despite this apparent equivalence between array and pointer variables, there is still a distinction to be made between them. Even though the name of an array is, in most expression contexts, converted into a pointer (to its first element), this pointer does not itself occupy any storage; the array name is not an <a href="/wiki/Value_(computer_science)" title="Value (computer science)">lvalue</a>, and its address is a <i>constant</i>, unlike a pointer variable. Consequently, what an array "points to" cannot be changed, and it is impossible to assign a new address to an array name. Array contents may be copied, however, by using the <code>memcpy</code> function, or by accessing the individual elements.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Memory_management">Memory management</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19" title="Edit section: Memory management">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>One of the most important functions of a programming language is to provide facilities for managing <a href="/wiki/Computer_memory" title="Computer memory">memory</a> and the objects that are stored in memory. C provides three distinct ways to allocate memory for objects:<sup id="cite_ref-bk21st_28-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bk21st-28"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/wiki/Static_memory_allocation" title="Static memory allocation">Static memory allocation</a>: space for the object is provided in the binary at compile-time; these objects have an <a href="/wiki/Variable_(programming)#Scope_and_extent" title="Variable (programming)" class="mw-redirect">extent</a> (or lifetime) as long as the binary which contains them is loaded into memory.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Automatic_memory_allocation" title="Automatic memory allocation" class="mw-redirect">Automatic memory allocation</a>: temporary objects can be stored on the <a href="/wiki/Call_stack" title="Call stack">stack</a>, and this space is automatically freed and reusable after the block in which they are declared is exited.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation" title="Dynamic memory allocation" class="mw-redirect">Dynamic memory allocation</a>: blocks of memory of arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such as <code><a href="/wiki/Malloc" title="Malloc" class="mw-redirect">malloc</a></code> from a region of memory called the <a href="/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation" title="Dynamic memory allocation" class="mw-redirect">heap</a>; these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling the library function <code><a href="/wiki/Malloc" title="Malloc" class="mw-redirect">realloc</a></code> or <code><a href="/wiki/Malloc" title="Malloc" class="mw-redirect">free</a></code></li>
</ul>
<p>These three approaches are appropriate in different situations and have various tradeoffs. For example, static memory allocation has little allocation overhead, automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead, and dynamic memory allocation can potentially have a great deal of overhead for both allocation and deallocation. The persistent nature of static objects is useful for maintaining state information across function calls, automatic allocation is easy to use but stack space is typically much more limited and transient than either static memory or heap space, and dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation of objects whose size is known only at run-time. Most C programs make extensive use of all three.</p>
<p>Where possible, automatic or static allocation is usually simplest because the storage is managed by the compiler, freeing the programmer of the potentially error-prone chore of manually allocating and releasing storage. However, many data structures can change in size at runtime, and since static allocations (and automatic allocations before C99) must have a fixed size at compile-time, there are many situations in which dynamic allocation is necessary.<sup id="cite_ref-bk21st_28-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bk21st-28"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Prior to the C99 standard, variable-sized arrays were a common example of this. (See the article on <code><a href="/wiki/Malloc" title="Malloc" class="mw-redirect">malloc</a></code> for an example of dynamically allocated arrays.) Unlike automatic allocation, which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences, the dynamic allocation functions return an indication (in the form of a null pointer value) when the required storage cannot be allocated. (Static allocation that is too large is usually detected by the <a href="/wiki/Linker_(computing)" title="Linker (computing)">linker</a> or <a href="/wiki/Loader_(computing)" title="Loader (computing)">loader</a>, before the program can even begin execution.)</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, static objects contain zero or null pointer values upon program startup. Automatically and dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if an initial value is explicitly specified; otherwise they initially have indeterminate values (typically, whatever <a href="/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bit pattern<the

All collocations are based on searching for the nearest neighbour in the

similar orbital characteristics of NOAA-18, NOAA-19 (both are part of
AVHRR-PM), Aqua and CALIPSO, a very large set of collocations between these
passive imagers and CALIOP was found with only short temporal mismatches. A
time window of <inline-formula><mml:math id="M292" display="inline"><mml:mo>ֲ±</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>3ג€¯min was used in these cases. The orbital

show a clear liquid bias, meaning an overestimation of the occurrence of
liquid clouds at the cost of ice clouds. A liquid bias can be explained by a
lack of sensitivity of the passive imager retrievals to optically very thin
ice cloud layers above liquid cloud layers. This is supported by the lower
POD<inline-formula><mml:math id="M306" display="inline"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ice</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> values compared to POD<inline-formula><mml:math id="M307" display="inline"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">liquid</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

phase (increased POD<inline-formula><mml:math id="M309" display="inline"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ice</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) while at the same time the detection
efficiency for liquid phase (POD<inline-formula><mml:math id="M310" display="inline"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">liq</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) decreases only slightly. The
biases change towards ice (reduced liquid bias or ice bias instead of liquid
bias). The results show that the correct cloud phase determination for
passive imager retrieval is very sensitive to phase changes in the uppermost
cloud layers (e.g. between the physical cloud top and 1 optical depth into
the cloud). In addition to the CPH comparisons presented, the scores were
again calculated including only conditions for which no phase change occurred
in the CALIOP data between the physical cloud top and 1 optical depth into
the cloud (not shown). The agreement between Cloud_cci datasets and CALIOP
data further improves significantly. Hit rates increase by 2 to 10ג€¯%,
mainly driven by a much better detection probability for ice clouds.</p>
      <p id="d1e6067">In Tableֲ <xref ref-type="table" rid="Ch1.T8"/> the validation results for CTH are
presented, i.e. standard and mean deviations. The comparisons were limited to
those collocated pixels for which both CALIOP and the Cloud_cci dataset
report clouds and valid retrievals of cloud phase and cloud-top height. In
addition, the data were restricted to cases where the phase assignment between
CALIOP and the Cloud_cci dataset is in agreement. Removing this uncertainty
in the phase assignment gives a clearer picture of the actual cloud-top
height retrieval, since the first guess of COT, CER and CTP in the Cloud_cci
retrieval systems is a function of the prior determined cloud phase. The
comparisons were separated into liquid and ice cloud conditions and carried
out twice using different top-down cloud optical depth levels
(COD<inline-formula><mml:math id="M311" display="inline"><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">lev</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) at which the reference CTH was selected from CALIOP

datasets and CALIOP is around 1ג€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M312" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the bias is generally below

thicknesses. For ice clouds the agreement with CALIOP is lower as expected.
Standard deviations range from 1.9 to 2.8ג€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M317" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and the bias is

      <p id="d1e6242">LWP retrievals were validated against LWP data derived from satellite-based,
passive microwave (MW) data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx33" id="paren.52"/>. Microwave radiation can
normally fully penetrate clouds. Thus, MW measurements can provide a direct
measurement of the total liquid cloud condensate amount. Shortcomings of the
MW data usually exist for scenes with low LWP and scenes with clouds that
also contain large solid (ice) and liquid (rain) particles. Because of this
and because of the different orbital characteristics of the MW-sensor
carrying satellites our validation focused on Level-3C (i.e. monthly
averages) in three stratocumulus regions for which ice cloud occurrence is
very low. The regions are the oceanic area west of Africa at

accuracy of 15ג€“30ג€¯% and contain monthly mean diurnal cycle products,
from which the 10:30 and 13:30 values were taken to match the
Cloud_cci morning and afternoon sensors, respectively. For the validation
scores presented in Tableֲ <xref ref-type="table" rid="Ch1.T9"/>, only the common overlap
period among all Cloud_cci datasets and the MW data were considered (2003 to
2008). The validation scores vary among the Cloud_cci datasets but also
among the three regions under consideration. Considering the correlation
coefficients, the SAF region exhibits the best agreement with the MW for all
Cloud_cci datasets, which might be due to the large seasonal cycle of LWP in
this region. Bias and bias-corrected root mean square errors (bc-RMSEs) do
not differ from the other regions, yxcept for the afternoon satellite
datasets AVHRR-PM and MODIS-Aqua, which show best scores for SAF. The
ATSR2-AATSR and MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M337" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR datasets have the largest deviations to the MW
data for all three regions. For all other datasets very small positive or
moderately negative biases are found, and thus a slight underestimation of LWP
compared to MW. Considering the given uncertainty estimates for the reference
data (15ג€“30ג€¯%), one can still conclude that there is agreement
between all Cloud_cci datasets and MW in nearly all regions. It is worth
mentioning that the agreement with MW reduces when considering the time period
before 2003 for AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM and ATSR2-AATSR. This is mainly due to
problems with the earlier satellites, which can also be seen in the LWP time
series plots of Figs.ֲ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="Ch1.F8"/> and

  <title>Summary</title>
      <p id="d1e6345">In this paper cloud property datasets generated within the ESA Cloud_cci
project were presented. The datasets are based on passive imager measurements
on board polar-orbiting satellites. The measurement records have been
characterized carefully and, in the case of AVHRR, been re-calibrated. Two
retrieval systems were developed: (1)ֲ the Community Cloud retrieval for
CLimate (CC4CL) which was applied to AVHRR as well as to the AVHRR heritage
channels measured by MODIS, ATSR2 and AATSR, and (2)ֲ the Freie
Universitֳ₪t Berlin AATSR MERIS Cloud (FAME-C) which was applied to
combined MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M338" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR measurements.</p>
      <p id="d1e6355">Based on these new developments, global cloud climatologies were generated
for all mentioned sensors spanning their entire life time. The datasets are
named: AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, ATSR2-AATSR and
MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M339" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR. The cloud properties derived are cloud mask/fraction, cloud
phase, cloud-top pressure/height/temperature, cloud optical thickness, cloud
effective radius, liquid/ice water path and spectral cloud albedo. The data
is available as pixel-based retrievals (Level-2), globally gridded composites
(Level-3U) and monthly summaries of the cloud properties (Level-3C):
averages, standard deviations and histograms. The OE-based uncertainty
information per pixel (contained in Level-2 and Level-3U) was propagated
into Level-3C data using an introduced mathematical framework
(Eqs.ֲ <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="Ch1.E4"/> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="Ch1.E5"/>). While the main
characteristics of all datasets are very similar to the AVHRR-PM examples
shown, it needs to be noted that some deviations exist. These are mainly
introduced by differences in spatio-temporal observation frequency, remaining
differences in spectral properties among the considered sensors and
differences in retrieval systems, i.e. for MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M340" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR dataset.</p>
      <p id="d1e6376">Level-2 validation of cloud mask, cloud phase and cloud-top height against
CALIOP revealed a probability of correct detection of cloudy and clear-sky
scenes between 70 and 90ג€¯% (hit rates), with a general
underestimation of cloud occurrence frequency when compared to all detected
clouds in CALIOP data, which reflects the detection limitation of passive
imagers. Neglecting optically very thin clouds in CALIOP data improves the
agreement in terms of probability of detection and biases. For cloud phase,
hit rates of 70ג€“80ג€¯% are reached with a bias towards liquid clouds (except
the MERIS<inline-formula><mml:math id="M341" display="inline"><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>AATSR dataset) when comparing to the uppermost cloud layer of
CALIOP data. When comparing against the CALIOP phase taken at a top-down
cloud optical depth of 0.15 into the cloud, hit rates increase by
approximately 5ג€¯% along with a reduction in the biases. Validating
cloud-top height gives generally small standard deviations and biases for
liquid clouds, while the agreement with CALIOP is lower for ice clouds. For ice
clouds, a strong dependence on the reference level from which the CALIOP
cloud-top height is taken is found. Biases reduce to <inline-formula><mml:math id="M342" display="inline"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.8 to
<inline-formula><mml:math id="M343" display="inline"><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1.99ג€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M344" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvaviant="normal">km</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> when the reference CALIOP cloud-top height is taken at a
top-down optical depth of 1 into the cloud top. Monthly mean liquid water
path was validated against passive, microwave-based satellite data. The mean
and standard deviations are relatively diverse and strongly dependent on the
dataset and region. However, for most Cloud_cci datasets and considered
regions agreement with the reference data within the reported uncertainty of
the reference data (15ג€“30ג€¯<inline-formula><mml:math id="M345" display="inline"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) was found.</p>
      <p id="d1e6414"><?xmltex \hack{\newpage}?>The validation results presented here, as well as the very comprehensive
Cloud_cci validation report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1.bibx46" id="paren.55"/>, have proven the
comparability of Cloud_cci datasets with already existing datasets of the
same kind. However, additionally ensuring spectral consistency and adding
rigorously propagated uncertainty measures make the Cloud_cci datasets
distinct from them. The evaluation process of the presented datasets has also
revealed some limitations, of which the most important ones are listed in
Appendixֲ <xref ref-type="sec" rid="App1.Ch1.S2"/>. In the near future, the Cloud_cci
retrieval systems will undergo a revision, e.g. improving the forward models
and LUTs and revising the BRDF for snow and ice surfaces. Based on these
developments the datasets will be reprocessed, also including more recent
time periods. Along with that, the product portfolio will be extended to
include broad-band radiation flux properties at the surface and TOA, which will
allow several new applications such as studying the cloud radiative effect.</p>
      <p id="d1e6424">Applying the same retrieval system to multiple sensors also facilitates a
combination of the individual datasets, ideally leading to higher quality.
This will be subject to future studies. In addition to such a combination of
the datasets, the consistency among them (i.e. by using the same retrieval
system) will also enable studies that investigate the impact of the imaging
characteristics of the different sensors on derived cloud climatologies.
These imaging characteristics are, for example, the spatial resolution

Two retrieval systems were developed that include components for cloud
detection and cloud typing followed by cloud property retrievals based on the
optimal estimation (OE) technique. The OE-based retrievals are applied to
simultaneously retrieve cloud-top pressure, cloud particle effective radius
and cloud optical thickness using measurements at visible, near-infrared and
thermal infrared wavelengths, which ensures spectral consistency. The
retrieved cloud properties are further processed to derive cloud-top height,
cloud-top temperature, cloud liquid water path, cloud ice water path and
spectral cloud albedo. The Cloud_cci products are pixel-based retrievals,
daily composites of those on a global equal-angle latitudeג€“longitude grid,
and monthly cloud properties such as averages, standard deviations and
histograms, also on a global grid. All products include rigorous propagation
of the retrieval and sampling uncertainties. Grouping the orbital properties
of the sensor families, six datasets have been defined, which are named
AVHRR-AM, AVHRR-PM, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, ATSR2-AATSR and MERIS+AATSR,
each comprising a specific subset of all available sensors. The individual
characteristics of the datasets are presented together with a summary of the
retrieval systems and measurement records on which the dataset generation
were based. Example validation results are given, based on comparisons to
well-established reference observations, which demonstrate the good quality
of the data. In particular the ensured spectral consistency and the rigorous
uncertainty propagation through all processing levels can be considered as
new features of the Cloud_cci datasets compared to existing datasets. In
addition, the consistency among the individual datasets allows for a
potential combination of them as well as facilitates studies on the impact of
temporal sampling and spatial resolution on cloud climatologies.</p><p class="p">For
