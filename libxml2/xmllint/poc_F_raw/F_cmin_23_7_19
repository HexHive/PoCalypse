comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
chaage expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan Connolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),

move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',

uppmrcase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate
recent WG decisions and other corrections:
binding sources of character encoding info (27 Aug / 3 Sept),
correct wording of Faust quotatiot (restore dropped line),
drop SDD from EncodingDecl,
change text at version number 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,

change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normalization in public identifiers,
add description of how to generate our name-space rules from

</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>

<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with
SGML TC (as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first iX an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic chtnges,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for igiored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs fi‡ding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.

Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors

for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>

declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>

</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.

suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments Cre /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references;
introduce some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>

<sitem>1996-10-10/11 : CMSMcQ : various maintenance, stylistic, and

Replace a few literals with xmlpio and
pic entities, to make them consistent and ensure we can change pic
reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of
delimiter escaping.
Streamline discussion of doctype decl syntax.
Drop old section of 'PI syntax' for doctype decl, and add
section on partial-DTD summary PIs to end of Logical Structures

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documents.
</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <tp of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Applicat_on">It is assumed that an XML processor is
doing its work on behalf of another0module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the arspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></itemee/olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>may</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML
processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>must</label>
<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.
<!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->
</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>error</label>
<def><p><termdef id='dt-error' term='Error'
>A violation of the rules of this
specification; results are
undefined.  Conforming software may detect and report an error and may
recover from it.</termdef></p></def>
</gitref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref>
must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the
processor may continue
processing the data to search for further errors and may report such
errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.e., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).
</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>at user option</label>
<def><p>Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in the
sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must
provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>validity constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all 
<termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents.
Violations of validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, 
be reported by 
<termref def="dt-validating">validating XML processors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>well-formedness constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all <termref
def="dt-wellformed">well-formed</termref> XML documents.
Violations of well-formedness constraints are 
<termref def="dt-fatal">fatal errors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>

<gitem>
<label>match</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-match" term="match">(Of strings or names:) 
Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g.
characters with 
both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the
same repreings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some canonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
(Of content and content models:)
An element matches its declaration when it conforms
in the fashion described in the constraint
<specref ref='elementvalid'/>.

<p>C is an <a href="/wiki/Imperative_programming" title="Imperative programming">imperative</a> (<a href="/wiki/Procedural_programming" title="Procedural programming">procedural</a>) language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward <a href="/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a>, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal <a href="/wiki/Run-time_system" title="Run-time system">run-time support</a>. C was therefore useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>, such as in <a 













































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































rsXon">recursion</a>, while a static <a href="/wiki/Type_system" title="Type system">type system</a> prevents many unintended operations. In C, all executable code is contained within <a href="/wiki/Subroutines" title="Subroutines" class="mw-redirect">subroutines</a>, which are called "functions" (although not in the strict sense of <a href="/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional programming">functional programming</a>). Function <a href="/wiki/Parameter_(computer_science)" title="Parameter (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">parameters</a> are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing <a href="/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)" title="Pointer (computer programming)">pointer</a> values. C program source text is <a href="/wiki/Free-form_language" title="Free-form language">free-format</a>, using the <a href="/wiki/Semicolon" title="Semicolon">semicolon</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Statement_(programming)" title="Statement (programming)" class="mw-redirect">statement</a> terminator and <a href="/wiki/Curly_braces#Curly_brackets_.7B_.7D" title="Curly braces" class="mw-redirect">curly braces</a> for grouping blocks of statements.</p>
<p>The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of <a href="/wiki/Flow_of_control" title="Flow of control" class="mw-redirect">flow of control</a> primitives: <code><a href="/wiki/For_loop" title="For loop">for</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Conditional_(programming)" title="Conditional (programming)" class="mw-redirect">if/else</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/While_loop" title="While loop">while</a></code>, <code><a href="/wiki/Switch_statement" title="Switch statement">switch</a></code>, and <code><a href="/wiki/Do_while_loop" title="Do while loop">do/while</a></code>. There is one <a href="/wiki/Namespace" title="Namespace">namespace</a>, and user-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of <a href="/wiki/Sigil_(computer_programming)" title="Sigil (computer programming)">sigil</a>.</li>
<li>There are a large number of arithmetical and logical operators, such as <code>+</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>++</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>~</code>, etc.</li>
<li>More than one <a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> may be performed in a single statement.</li>
<li>Function return values can be ignored when not needed.</li>
<li>Typing is <a href="/wiki/Static_typing" title="Static typing" class="mw-redirect">static</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Weak_typing" title="Weak typing" class="mw-redirect">weakly enforced</a>: all data has a type, but implicit conversions can be performed; for instance, characters can be used as integers.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Declaration_(computer_programming)" title="Declaration (computer programming)">Declaration</a> <a href="/wiki/C_syntax" title="C syntax">syntax</a> mimics usage context. C has no "define" keyword; instead, a statement beginning with the name of a type is taken as a declaration. There is no "function" keyword; instead, a function is indicated by the parentheses of an argument list.</li>
<li>User-defined (<code>typedef</code>) and compound types are possible.
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneous aggregate data types (<code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code>) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Array_data_type" title="Array data type">Array</a> indexing is a secondary notion, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic. Unlike structs, arrays are not first-class objects; they cannot be assigned or compared using single built-in operators. There is no "array" keyword, in use or definition; instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, e.g. <code>month[11]</code>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enumerated_type" title="Enumerated type">Enumerated types</a> are possible with the <code>enum</code> keyword. They are not tagged, and are freely interconvertible with integers.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/String_(computer_science)" title="String (computer science)">Strings</a> are not a separate data type, but are conventionally implemented as <a href="/wiki/Null-tement</a> for <code>struct</code> data types</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enumerated_type" title="Enumerated type">enumerated types</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a <a href="/wiki/C_standard_library" title="C standard library">standard library</a>, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&amp;R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.</p>

Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, developers of the C programming language.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> operating system, originally implemented in assembly language on a <a href="/wiki/PDP-7" title="PDP-7">PDP-7</a> by Ritchie and Thompson, incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually they decided to port the operating system to a <a href="/wiki/PDP-11" title="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. The original PDP-11 version of Unix was developed in <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly language</a>. The developers were consideing to rewrite the system using the <a href="/wiki/B_language" title="B language" class="mw-redirect">B language</a>. However B's inability to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's features, notably <a href="/wiki/Byte" title="Byte">byte</a> addressability, led to the development of C.</p>
<p>The initial development of C occurred at <a href="/wiki/AT%26T_Bell_Labs" title="AT&amp;T Bell Labs" class="mw-redirect">AT&amp;T Bell Labs</a> between 1969 and 1973;<sup id="cite_ref-dottcl_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dottcl-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> according to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972. At that year a great part of Unix was rewritten in C.<sup id="cite_ref-Stallings_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Stallings-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> By 1973, with the addition of <code>struct</code> types, the C language had become powerful enough that most of the <a href="/wiki/Unix" title="Unix">Unix</a> <a href="/wiki/Kernel_(computing)" title="Kernel (computing)">kernel</a> was now in C. The new language was named "C" because its features were derived from "<a href="/wiki/B_(programming_language)" title="B (programming language)">B</a>", which according to <a href="/wiki/Ken_Thompson_(computer_programmer)" title="Ken Thompson (computer programmer)" class="mw-redirect">Ken to spson</a> was a stripped-down version of the <a h@ef="/wiki/BCPL" title="BCPL">BCPL</a> programming language.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Unix was one of the first operating system kernels implemented in a language other than <a href="/wiki/Assembly_language" title="Assembly language">assembly</a>. (Earlier instances include the <a href="/wiki/Multics" title="Multics">Multics</a> system (written in <a href="/wiki/PL/I" title="PL/I">PL/I</a>), and MCP (<a href="/wiki/MCP_(Burroughs_Large_Systems)" title="MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)" class="mw-redirect">Master Control Program</a>) for the <a href="/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems" title="Burroughs large systems">Burroughs B5000</a> written in <a href="/wiki/ALGOL" title="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> in 1961.) Circa 1977, further changes to the language were made by Ritchie and <a href="/wiki/Stephen_C._Johnson" title="Stephen C. Johnson">Stephen C. Johnson</a> to facilitate portability of the Unix operating system. Johnson's <a href="/wiki/Portable_C_Compiler" title="Portable C Compiler">Portable C Compiler</a> served as the basis for several implementations of C on new platforms.<sup id="cite_ref-unixport_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-unixport-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="K.26R_C">K&amp;R C</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=C_(programming_language)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: K&amp;R C">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In 1978, <a href="/wiki/Brian_Kernighan" title="Brian Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie" title="Dennis Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> published the first edition of <i><a href="/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language" title="The C Programming Language">The C Programming Language</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r1e_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r1e-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> This book, known to C programmers as "K&amp;R", served for many years as an informal <a href="/wiki/Specification" title="Specification" class="mw-redirect">specification</a> of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as <i>K&amp;R C</i>. The second edition of the book<sup id="cite_ref-k.26r2e_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-k.26r2e-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> covers the later <a href="/wiki/ANSI_C" title="ANSI C">ANSI C</a> standard.</p>
<p>K&amp;R introduced several language features:</p>
<ul>
<li>standard I/O library</li>
<li><code>long int</code> data type</li>
<li><code>unsigned int</code> data type</li>
<li>compound assignment operators of the form <code>=</code><i>op</i> (such as <code>=-</code>) were changed to the form <i>op</i><code>=</code> to remove the semantic ambiguity created by such constructscode>i=-10</code>, which had been interpreted as <code>i&#160;=-&#160;10</code> (decrement i by 10) instead of the possibly intended <code>i&#160;=&#160;-10</code> (let i be -10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even after the publication of the 1989 C standard, for many years K&amp;R C was still considered the "<a href="/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator_(computers)" title="Lowest common denominator (computers)" class="mw-redirect">lowest common denominator</a>" to which C programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired, since many older compilers were still in use, and because carefully written K&amp;R C code can be legal Standard C as well.</p>
<p>In early versions of C, only functions that returned a non-<code>int</code> value needed to be declared if used before the function definition; a function used without any previous declaration was assumed to return type <code>int</code>, if its value was used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div dir="ltr" class="mw-geshi mw-code mw-content-ltr">
<div class="cpp source-cpp">
<pre class="de1">
<span class="kw4">long</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
 
<span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> calling_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span>
<span class="br0">{</span>
    <span class="kw4">long</span> test1<span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw4">register</span> <span class="coMULTI">/* int */</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
 
    test1 <span class="sy1">=</span> some_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">if</span> <span class="br0">(</span>test1 <span class="sy1">&gt;</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="br0">)</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> <span class="nu0">0</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">else</span>
          test2 <span class="sy1">=</span> other_function<span class="br0">(</span><span class="br0">)</span><span class="sy4">;</span>
    <span class="kw1">return</span> test2<span class="sy4">;</span>
<span class="br0">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code>int</code> type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted in K&amp;R C, but are required in later standards.</p>
<p>Since K&amp;R function declarations did not include any information about function arguments, function parameter <a href="/wiki/Type_checking" title="Type checking" class="mw-redirect">type checks</a> were not performed, although some compilers would issue a warning message if a local function was called with the wrong number of arguments, or if multiple calls to an external function used different numbers or types of arguments. Separate tools such as Unix's <a href="/wiki/Lint_programming_tool" title="Lint programming tool" class="mw-redirect">lint</a> utility were developed that (among other things) could check for consistency of function use across multiple source files.</p>
<p>In the years following the publication of K&amp;R C, several unofficial features were added to the language, supported by compilers from AT&amp;T and some other vendors. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a href="/wiki/Void_type" title="Void type">void</a></code> functions (i.e. functions with no return value)</li>
<li>functions returning <code><a href="/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)" title="Struct (C programming language)">struct</a></code> or <code><a href="/wiki/Union_(computer_science)" title="Union (computer science)" class="mw-redirect">union</a></code> types (rather than pointers)</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)" title="Assignment (computer science)">assignment</a> for <code>struct</code> data types</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Enumerated_type" title="Enumerated type">enumerated types</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The large number of extensions and lack of agreement on a <a href="/wiki/C_standard_library" title="C standard library">standard library</a>, together with the language popularity and the fact that not even the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&amp;R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="ANSI_C_and_ISO_C">ANSI C and ISO C</span><span class="mw-editsevalid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be 
<termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref> if it is used.
When declared, it must be given as an 
<termref def='dt-enumerated'>enumerated type</termref> whose only
possible values are "<code>default</code>" and "<code>preserve</code>".
For example:<eg><![CDATA[    <!ATTLIST poem   xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>]]></eg></p>
<p>The value "<code>default</code>" signals that applications'
default white-space processing modes are acceptable for this element; the
value "<code>preserve</code>" indicates the intent that applications preserve
all the white space.
This declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the content
of the element where it is specified, unless overriden with another instance
of the <kw>xml:space</kw> attribute.
</p>
<p>The <termref def='dt-root'>root element</termref> of any document
is considered to have signaled no intentions as regards application space
handling, unless it provides a value for 
this attribute or the attribute is declared with a default value.

<head>End-of-Line Handling</head>
<p>XML <termref def='dt-parsedent'>parsed entities</termref> are often stored in
computer files which, for editing convenience, are organized into lines.
These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters
carriage-return (#xD) and line-feed (#xA).</p>
<p>To simplify the tasks of <termref def='dt-app'>applications</termref>,
wherever an external parsed entity or the literal entity value
of an internal parsed entity contains either the literal 
two-character sequence "#xD#xA" or a standalone literal
#xD, an <termref def='dt-xml-proc'>XML processor</termref> must 
pass to the application the single character #xA.
(This behavior can 
conveniently be produced by normalizing all 
line breaks to #xA on input, before parsing.)

<head>Language Identification</head>
<p>In document processing, it is often useful to
identify the natural or formal language 
in which the content is 
written.
A special <termref def="dt-attr">attribute</termref> named
<kw>xml:lang</kw> may be inserted in
documents to specify the 
language used in the contents and attribute values 
of any element in an XML document.
In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be 
<termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref> if it is used.
The values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined
by <bibref ref="RFC1766"/>, "Tags for the Identification of Languages":
