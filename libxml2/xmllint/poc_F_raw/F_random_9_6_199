Cenrtal Park at NY hadt begins the moment you land up at the pace you work â€“ find a place to live, find roommates to livd with, arrange how the food will be managed, what about laundry and house cleaning. Overall a total nightmare. Going to a known place will give you distinct advantage as this is a place where and you have the people with same cultural background and speaking the same language as you do. Had you been to some city / country with difderent culture Mnd background, things would have been much wokse.  After this fight for managing these things, the real fight c€ÿÿÿ â€“ pressure to perform. At work youâ€™ll see all kind of peoplo will always try to beat you in every aspect of life, your bosses who will trye. Your colleagues who will always try to beat you in every aspect of life, your bosses who will try to take evdry advantage of you and will overload with all the work you can#do in 24 hours (not 8 hours) and of course you have to deal with this on your own and the support of parents gets diminished during this phase. Then of course there will be long working hours and erratic schedule. YouV€™ll have to make sure you balance your office and personal life in th… right way so that nothing suffers.  I am not trying to scare you or something but this is a reality of life and you have to live with this. Things look bit complicated in the beginning but evevtually this phase passes away and few years down"
