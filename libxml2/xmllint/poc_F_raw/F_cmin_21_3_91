		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is used here, is an explicit relationship between two or more data objects or portions of data objects. This specification is concerned with the syntax used to assert link existence and describe link characteristics. Implicit (unasserted) relationships, for example that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an HTML <code>A</code> link, and has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of its ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in some document)</p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><p>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link itself. For example, traveral of <code>A</code> links normally replaces the current view, perhaps with a user option to op element in the containing resource that has an XML <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-attrtypes">ID attribute</xtermref> whose value <xtermref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#dt-match">matches</xtermref> the 				  <xnt href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-Name">Name</xnt>. This shorthand is to encourage use of the robust <code>id</code> addressing men a new window.</p></item>
				<item><p>The link goes to only one destination (although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destiŽation).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of these assumptions also limits the range of hypertext functionality. The linking model defined here provides ways to create links that go beyond each of these specific characteristics, thus providing features previously available mostly in dedicated hypermedia systems.

	<head>Origin and Goals</head>	<p>Following the design principles governing XLink:
		<olist>
			<item><p>XLink must be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. </p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be usable by a wide variety of link usage domains and classes of linking application software.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must support HTML 4.0 linking constructs.</p></item>
			<item><p>The XLink expression language must be XML.</p></item>
			<item><p>The XLink design must be formal, concise, an                                                              is:ExportID>

            <hmis:ExportP                                            and standards.</p></item>

	<head>Relationship to Existing Standards</head>
	<p>Three standards have been especially influential:
		<ulist>
			<item><p><emph>HTML:</emph> Defines several SGML element types that represent links.</p></item>
			<item><p><emph>HyTime:</emph> Defines inline and out-of-line link structures and some semantic features, includin
