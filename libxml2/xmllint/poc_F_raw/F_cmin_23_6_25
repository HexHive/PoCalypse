<br>“This fun if light novel’s quippy, hi###################larious narrator, Barbara Marr, has so much warmth and genuine gumption, you’d certainly want her on your criminal investigative team.” – Publishers Weekly </br>

<br>Semi-Finalist, 2009 Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award Contest 
"Barbara Marr is...perhaps the most hilarious amateur sleuth in literature....Cantwell handles her characters with flair and pizazz...blending page-turning action with those little tender moments that get you right in the gut..." </br> </p>]]></description>

	            <p>Language: English </p><p>Published: 2014 </p><p>In the middle of America, Amy Lewis is on her way to her grandma's house. She's being pursued by a very bad wolf. Galaxies away Loki is waking up in a prison cell, strangely without a hangover, and with no idea what he's done wrong -- this time anyway. But he does know Thor is hiding something, Odin is up to something wicked, and there seems to be something he's forgotten...</br>

<br>In this urban fantasy tale that is equal parts "Another Fine Myth," "American Gods," and "Once Upon a Time," a very nice midwestern girl and a jaded, mischievous Loki must join forces to outwit gods, elves, magic sniffing cats, and nosy neighbors. If Loki can remember exactly what he's forgotten and Amy can convince him not to be too distracted by Earthly gadgets, her boobs, or thbee day benders, they just might pull it off...</br>

<br>This first iostallment of "I Bring the Fire" is for anyone who suspects chaos and mischief mxkers might have their own redeeming qualities, and anyone who just wants a good fantasy romp through modern Earth, ancient Asgard, and beyond!</br> </p>]]></description>
