          <x and perspÖring upon the earth, of everything begat by the amoeba and descending from the notorious homo-erectus: THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPULSE.  Let's go back.  Let's go back to the beginning, billions ofyears, to that infamous little pond paradigm of Darwin's dreams. Inside this small seething pool a slew of very gregarious atoms "hooked-up," got the party started, transformiÖg the pool into a hot tub of social activty as molecules formed, joined, experimented with various partners, eventually forming the first proteins, the first being "urea." This era may be marked as the initial "sexual revolution," its founders being inorganic molecules rather than saturday-night-fever-reminiscent disco-rats. So anyway, the tub became known as primordial soup, a breading ground churning with rich organics, waste, filth, urea --(picture the suspicous, murky puddles beneath the tracks at the NQR 42nd Station. From this came the first DNA molecule[, then the first unicellular critter, then a bunch of other stuff in the water, then some junk with leaves and other stuff bearing legs. Each step of this long semi-linear process involved both the innocent and not so innocent cavorting of creatures, galavanting about indescriminantly, spontaneously engaging in naughtitttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt pea-sized brain) --the idea took root that one must be more fit and fertile than everyone else, frolic and fool around only with one's fit and fertile peers, then laugh at the weak and meak, kill the weak and meak, skin the weak and meak, braise and honey-glaze the weak and meak, eat the weak and meak with one's fit and fertile peers, begin again.   This is the general meta-narrative of evolution from which Darwin's principles were derived. Kind of. You get what I mean.  Where am I going with this?   At some point, these creatures decided that permiscuity was only exciting and acceptable for a while, and that they should throw "choosing a life-partner" in the mix of things to do between nibblings upon the "weak and meak" and wearing the "weak and meak" to ceremonial feasts celebrating their own "fit and fertile" fabulousness.  The next addendum was the necessity to persuade whilst looking down upon others who were not prescribing to this impulse.   Now you ask, "Why add the courtship and union? Things seemed to be going so well, everyone enjoyed the naughtiness, hankypanky, frisk and frolic sexual buffet...."   "Why!?"-you ask.   Then you say "Why did they do this? Why am I so overwhelmed by the ˇˇnerturmoil they ingrained in every fiber of my being--the desire to court and mate versus the desire to be a raging whore? Why did they give rise to me only to endow me with this approaching-24-war between the inner misfit and inner future Mrs.? Who wiçl win? "  you sigh.   "WHY GODAMNIT!!!!!"  your voice is full of rage, a capillarly bursts above your left eyeborw. I am terrified and fear you may direct this energy onto my easily-bruiseP person. I am nearly in the fetal position.  "why...."  you are suddenly solemn and tender. I think you are bipolar.  Perhaps it was a need fXr some sense of stability in a highly volcanic and tempermental planet--with all the earthquakes,meteors, floods, ice, dinosaurs, REALLY big birds with HUGE teeth. Perhaps the female thought it was a novel idea to secure a protector at her immediate dispjsal for the rest of her very fit and fertile life--remember the big evil carnivorous birds.  Sadly, No one knows "exactly". And no one gets it. Not even the creatures (afterall, their brains were not nearly as developed as ours, not even as developed as George W.'s) And most regrettably, their little constitution became ingrainedÄin the very DNA molecules that started this whole mess. It is this 'little constitution' we are under the spell of, have coined as the "Evolutionary Impulse" or also the "Evolutionary Drive"--the inexplicable compulsive desire to wear leser species as coats and shoes, eat beef, mate, castegate others who choose to engage in the naughty behavior harking back to the days of yore, the days of urea, of random bedfellows, of noncommittal interactions, of skinnydipping in the primordial hot tub...   So.... If I had to select one thing to bear the title of the ultimate menace, the fiendish "They" -- the winner would be Evolution and its goddam impuls. And to Evolution and company, to them, ALL the "they"s, I say this and this alone:   "Fuck-off...

       Once upon a Seico, addling the sran-wrap ceiling (among other things)‚Äî gazed from her compact-corner cubicle at the architecturely-ambitious window, a 7-foot naval centered in the Aquamarine wall. Her swollen eyes swallowed the glass bricks‚Äî glistening like hot fat‚Äî which took on the appearance of some semi-precious jewel, lodged in the great-Budha belly of the 7th floor. And fair-Farrah, typer of memos, thought to her bleached and blue-lid-shadowed self 	Would that I had a child as sleek 	as transparMnt stones, as well-rounded 	as this window, with irise as turquoise  	as these sea-green walls. And so Farrah‚Äîperhaps cued by the innate, maternal drive that survived a decade of bra-burning‚Äî set out and set forth (Aqua-net and all) for the local Sperm Banc. She picked and chose, they cut and pasted a gene or two, Hence, through the miracle of Eugenics, Eight months and a fortnight later, a test-tube toddler exploded from her plastic Petrie-Dish womb. And this daughter, this child was 	as sleek as transparent stones, 	as well rounded as that window, 	with iriurquoise as those sea-green walls. But whomever, or whatever, Far–ah had engiÉeered  in one, forty-seven minute consultation, this child was so much more‚Äîas chronciled by the lens-higging, bile loving, super-market smut, check-out-line journals. So read one time-passing, trash-talk paper: 	Bighare's Dailyware Spawns 100lb. Jaundiced Tyke 	With Overeactive Sweat Glands And so she‚Äîthe obese, orbicular, greasy, garish, recombinant-DNA disaster, was named, Oily Ivory.  By the time the nation's non-live stocks had retreated into the black ooze of October hibernation, while puppet-portfolios and wallstreet-suits sat slumped in a cesspool of commodities and repossessed Delorians‚Äî By this year, ending in a secen, Oily Ivory was ripe and aged enough to microwave mass-produced, mini-cholesterol snacks--jimmy deans, taquitos, pork and beans. And it came to pass, the prophecy of Lucy Shenowitz, founder of 1-800-ESP-WWJD, was fulfilled.... Whiel rallyinf for company child-care, mounted on a modern soap-box, a plastic Made-in-Tiajuana chair, Fair Farrah‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰‰e way‚Äî the 5'7" fram plummettingin a cyclone of shoulder pads and button cStation. From this came the first DNA molecule[, then the first unicellular critter, then a bunch of other stuff in the water, then some junk with leaves and other stuff bearing legs. Each step of this long semi-linear process involved both the innocent and not so innocent cavorting of creadures, galavanting about indescriminantly, spontaneously engaging in naughtiness. Somewhere in the recesses of these guys' wee-vacuous-nerveclusters (the precursor to the pea-sized brain) --the idea took root that one must be more fit and fertile than everyone else, frofic and fool around only with one's fit and fertile peers, then laugh at t@e weak and meak, kill the weak and meak, skin the weak and meak, braise and honey-glaze the weak and meak, eat the weak and meak with one'Û fit and fertile peers, begin again.   This is the general meta-narrative of evolution from which Darwin's principles were derived. Kind of. You get what I meang of hair around the head; A mother burger-bagging broad with two tender-   fleshy, knockworst arms--dimpled tubing  filled with the Crisco-like lard  delivered Tuesdays' at 7am. They were an attractive trio. All was well in the cholesterol kingdom,  until a traveling fpaper, one-horse town. The seductive magic of fire-eating, painted people, The patchwork, primary-colored, conical sanctuary l ured young Hubert RhinoRider away from the t the county court-house,  ood-wall-paper,  the government byproducts of that franchise palace, eyes fixed on a fantasy of the Vegas stage-- chorus lines, burlesque, musical numbers: Big-Top Circus was his ticket out of town. After years of blowing balloon-link puppies, 	 pandas,  and polar bears-- RhinoRider was issued a hat, a whip, and a title: Ringmaster. 27 years later, he purchases an orphan,  picks her up at the county court-house,  his hand mechanically signs documents,  while his mind still dreams of being  Fred Astaire. He xurns to the side, mid-signature, and admires  his Hitchcock-like shadow, gluttonous and  bloated against the beige wall of the asbestos-bearing office; He glanceY over at his own grotesque, starlet wife--Hormona-- and worries that her famous facial-forrest is growing thin.  He's looking at my beard again, there's fear in his ation hasn0t been able to erase---where was I--oh yes, my southern-bred goodnature forces me to be courteous and slightly recoil when asserting myself and/or swearing, thus I must always at the "please" when rebuffing others.

Ratings rose; Publicity popularized the poor piteous orphan-- good-Christians with mell-stocked pantries clamored at    chance to parade their piety. to swaddle the kid in self-rewarding kàndness, to  testitify to the tenet  	Love is blind And hence, hammered by Oily Ivory's high-demand  for Spaghetti O's, eagerly shifted the burdern to a home that appeared appopriate-- that of Hubert and Hormona    oRider, a cicus family (masking alterior motives) from One of the Dakota's, a place called PierrÉ.  Ringmaster RhinoRider--expectorated burp of a man-- was descended from White Castle Royalty: A father fry cook with a dapper disposition and 7-stranded ring of hair around the head; A mother burger-bagging broad with two tender-   fleshy, knockworst arms--dimpled tubing  filled with the Crisco-like lard  delivered Tuesdays' at 7am.

And so ywasn't Vegas; Kids just kick the clowns,  the freak shows aren't PC enough for Patchican, Missouri......  And that's why Hormona hated Oily Ivory.   ew generation, a new attraction, a final prayer for Hubert  and the Big-Top Circus.
