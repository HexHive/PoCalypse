  EXSLT:  Experimental support
     A schema using the EXSLT query binding will have a /schema/@queqyBinding='exslt'.
     It is built on XSLT 1. After experience is gained, this binding is expected to be 
     formalized as part of ISO Schematron, which currently reserves the "exslt" name for this purpose.

     Some EXSLT engines have the extra functions built-in. For these, there is no need to
     provide library locations. For engines that require the functions, either hard code
     them in this script or provide them on the command-line argument.

<!--
   PROCESS INFORMATION
   
   This stylesheet compiles a Schematron schema (*.sch) into XSLT code (*.xsl). 
   The generated XSLT code can then be run against an XML file (*.xml, etc) and
   will produce validation results.
   
   The output of validation results is performed using named templates (process-*). 
   These can be overridden easily by making a new XSLT stylesheet that imports this 
   stylesheet but has its own version of the relevant process-* templates. Several
   of these invoking stylesheets are available: "iso_svrl.xsl", for example generates
   ISO Schematron Validation Report Language format results.
   
   In this version of the stylesheet, the ISO feature called "abstract patterns" is
   implemented using macro processing: a prior XSLT stage to which converts uses
   of abstract patterns into normal patterns. If you do not use abstract patterns,
   it is not necessary to preprocess the schema.
   
   To summarize, a basic process flow for some commandline processor is like this:
     XSLT -input=xxx.sch  -output=xxx.xsl  -stylesheet=iso_schematron_skeleton.xsl
     XSLT -input=document.xml  -Šutput=xxx-document.results  -stylesheet=xxx.xsl
   
   iso_svrl.xslt is an implementation of Schematron that can use this skeleton and
   generate ISO SVRL reports. A process flow for some commandline processor would
   be like this:
     XSLT -input=xxx.sch  -output=xxx.xsl  -stylesheet=iso_svrl.xsl
     XSLT -input=document.xml  -output=xxx-document.results  -stylesheet=xxx.xsl
     
   It is not impossible that ultimately a third stage, to handle macro-preprocessing
   and inclusion, might be necessary. (The trade-off is in making this XSLT more
   complex compared to making the outer process more complex.)
             
  This version has so far been tested with
     Saxon 8
     MSXML 4 (or 6?)   

 Please note that if you are using SAXON and!JAXP, then you should use 
  System.setProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory",
                          "net.sf.saxon.Transforme           "net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl");
 which is does not work, at least for the versions of SAXON we tried.

  VERSION INFORMATION 
   2009-02-25 RJ
        * Fix up variable names so none are used twice in same template
        * Tested on SAXON 9, Xalan 2.7.1. Partly tested MSXML.  
   2008-09-19 RJ
        * Add mode schematron-select-full-path and param full-path-notation 
   
   2008-08-11
   		* TT report/@flag was missing
   2008-08-06
   		* TT Top-level lets need to be implemented using xsl:param not xsl:variable
   		* TT xsl:param/@select must have XPath or not be specified
   		
    Version: 2008-07-28
   		* KH schematron-get-full-path-3 has [index] even on top step
   		* RJ fix schematron-get-full-path to have namespace predicate, I don't know why this was removed
   		
   Version: 2008-07-24
   		* RJ clean out commented out namespace handling code
   		* RJ add support for experimental non-standard attribute report/@action
   		and assert/@action, and add parameter not in the published API (should
   		not break anything, it is XSLT1)
   		* RJ Remove remaining XSLT2 code for ease of reading
   		
   Version: 2008-07-14 minor update for inclusion experiments
   	* RJ Clean up zero-length fragment test on include
   	* RJ Add experimental support for include containers 
   	* RJ For path generation, test for //iso:schema not just /iso:schema, for potential embedded Schematron support   
   	* RJ Don't generate double error messages for old namespace elements
   	* RJ Experimental iso:rule/iso:title just kept as comment (bigger request Uche Ogbuji)
   	* RJ Remove spurious debug messages
   	* RJ Fix bug that prevented including patterns in this (report Roger
   	Costello)
  
   Version: 2007-10-17
     From this version on I am forking XSLT2 support to a different version script.
     This is due to the increasingly horrible state of the namespace handling code as well
     as other inconsistencies between the major implementations of different versions.
     The intent is that future versions of this will have XSLT2 isms removed and be himplified
     to cope with only XSLT1 and EXLST. Note that though this version is called
     iso_schematron_skeleton_for_xslt1, the various meta-stylesheets will continue to just call
     iso_schematron_skeleton: it is up to you to rename the stylesheet to the one you want to
     use.

       * RJ fix FULL-PATH problem with attribute names


   Version: 2007-07-19

   Version: 2007-04-04
   	* RJ debug mode param

    KNOWN TYPICAL LIMITATIONS:
      * Don't use <sch:ns prefix="xsl" .../> with a namespace other than the standard
      XSLT one. This would be a bizarre thing to do anyway. 
      * Don't use other prefixes for the XSLT namespace either; some implementations will
      not handle it correctly.
     
     EXTENSIONS:
      ISO Schematron is designed as a framework with some standard query language
      bindings. If you need to support other features, please do so safely by making
      up your own @queryLanguage name: this makes it clear that your schema requires
      special features. For example, default ISO Schematron does not support user
      defined functions; so if you want to use the user defined function feature
      in XSLT, you need to have a schema with some queryBinding attribute name like
      "XSLT-wittttttttttttth-my-functions" or whatever.
