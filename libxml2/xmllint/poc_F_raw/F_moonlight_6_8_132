<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given
in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety o~ applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</à></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>

<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name iodes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>

<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:

processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>

<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.

a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->

errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.D., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).

paragraph awkward and redundant.  I agree it's logically redundant:
it *says* it is summarizing the logical implications of
matching the grammar, and that means by definition it's
logically redundant.  I don't think it's rhetorically
redundant or unnecessary, though, so I'm keeping it.  It
