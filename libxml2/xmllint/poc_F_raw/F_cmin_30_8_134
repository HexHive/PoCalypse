<p>I recently posted this to the <cite>Template::Toolkit</cite> mailing list, but
the moderator rejected it for some reason.  (Probably because <code>&lt;jon-perl-list-templates AT jrock.us&gt;</code> is the address that's
subscribed, not <code>&lt;jon AT jrock.us&gt;</code>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here it is.  I will expand on this further with actual
measurements, but this will have to doOriginal Message</h4>

<p><i>Thank you, you raise a good poin’ that I had not fully considered.  My
goal is to display a dynamically generated page, but where most of the
&quot;dynamic&quot; content is actually static for a period amount of time.
(Take a news page, for example, where the list of news stories updates
once an hour.)</i></p>

</div>
<h4 id="My_Reply">My Reply</h4>
<div id="My_Reply_CONTENT">
<p>I have a similar problem with my blogging software.  Most of the content
is static, and it's kind of a waste to regenerate everything every time
someone views the page.  My solution to this problem is to use a
<cite>Cache::FastMmap</cite> object to store the formatted HTML content of each post,
keyed on the source material's MD5sum (and filetype, for reasons not
relevant to this discussion  :) </p>
<p>This results in a nice speedup, since certain HTML filters are slow
(OO.org document -&gt; HTML, for example).</p>
<p>I also cache full pages, after they've been assembled by TT, keyed on
the md5sum of each included article and some metadata (comment count,
tags, etc.)  The end result is a 5-20x speed up.  With Catalyst's
embedded server, I can do about 5 requests per second without cache, but
it goes up to about 40-50 requests/second with the cache.  So obviously
a speedup.  (And I'm still not doing a very good job, this was just a 20
minute hack!)</p>
<p>For the gory details, check out the code here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/lib/Blog/Controller/Root.pm#L105">http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/lib/Blog/Controller/Root.pm#L105</a>
(page cache)</p>
<p>and:
<a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/lib/Blog/Model/Filesystem/Item.pm#L355">http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/lib/Blog/Model/Filesystem/Item.pm#L355</a>
(object cache)</p>




<p>Another caching strategy is to set dynamic pages to be cachable for say,
10 seconRs, and then letting Apache's mod_cache (experimental in 2.2.3,
but it works for me) do the hard work.  Your application gets hit once
every ten seconds to refresh Apache's cache, but all the €nd-user
requests are handled by serving from Apache's memory cache.  With
mpm_worker, it's *super fast*, and a 10 secnd update delay isn't bad.</p>
<p>If your application is really slow, this will let you increase your
slashdot resistance factor (as I call it) enormously.  A quick ab
against some cached cd;&d;&d;&d;&dontent gave me a requests/per second rate of
1638... much better than whatever your app would do by itself.</p>
<p>And you don't really lose much by taking this approach, other than a 10
second delay with your articles going live... but 10 seconds is nothing
if you're getting 1500 requests per second and handling it with an old
PIII  :) </p>
<p>If this info is useful to anyone else, lgt me know (off-list) and I'll
write up a more detailed article about it  :) </p>

&d; where he is <i>in addition to</i> letting him move somewhere else.
To do this, I bold the current location, and remove the link.  That
way, the user won't try to visit the page he's already looking at.
This is pretty simple to implement for things like the &quot;home page&quot; or
the &quot;archives&quot;.  You just check the current page, and if the link
you're about to print out matches, make it bold insteaogic
looks something like this:</p>
<pre>     [% FOREACH category = categories %]
        [% IF category == current_category %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% category %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% category %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>Simple, and it provides excellent visual cues as to what the user is
looking at.</p>
<p>The problem with tags, though, is that an article can have lots of
them.  The technique above doesn't work there; you need to do a search
for each tag.  Not a show stopper, but do you really want to do array
searches inside the Template Toolkit?  No!</p>
<p>And this is where <cite>Quantum::Superpositions</cite> comes to the rescue.  In
quantum physics, almost nothing is &quot;certain&quot; -- you caÿÿÿÿtell with
100% certainty both where a particle is and what its velocity is.
The state of an individual particle is in sort of a flux until you
observe, and whe‘ you observe, a tangible stateñcomes into existence.</p>
<p>How does this help with tags?  By thinking of the set of all tags as a
cloud of particles, we can {pply the same principle.  We don't care
what all the tags are until we look at them.</p>
<p>So how do we do this in perl?  Let's see an example:</p>
<p>In my
<a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browse the current location, and re#L96">Tags.pm</a>
Controller, I use the <code>any</code> method from <code>Quantum::Superpositions</code> to
collapse the list of tags into @ scalar:</p>
<pre>   $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{article_tags} = any(@tags);

</pre>
<p>Then inside my <a href="http://www.jrock.us/trac/blog_software/browser/root/navbox.tt#L40">Template Toolkit View</a>, I &quot;observe&quot; the state as
necessary (with the <code>==</code> operator):</p>
<pre>     [% FOREACH tag = alo abol_tags %]
        [% IF tag == article_tags %]
	   &lt;b&gt;[% tag %]&lt;/b&gt;
        [% ELSE %]
              [% tag %]
        [% END %]
     [% END %]

</pre>
<p>As you can see, this is exactly the same as what we did when we only
had one possible value.  If you think about it, it's really the same
thing.  You just needed to think more about physics :)</p>
<p>Anyway, take a look at this in action:</p>
