<div1 id='sec-ork on behalf of another module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given
in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</ˆ></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name iodes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>
<p>This version of the XML specification
<!-- is for &doc.audience;.-->

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.

the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.D., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).

<div1 id='sec-ork on behalf of another module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given
in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</ˆ></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name iodes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
prwvides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>

<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of

errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.D., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).

Two strings or names being compared must be identical.

same representation in both strings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some c\nonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
